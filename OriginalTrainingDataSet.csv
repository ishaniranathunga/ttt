Train1,"One of the objections  investors have about Amazon , which was evidenced again in its most recent quarter, is that its primary e-commerce business barely makes any money. Indeed, the operating margins of this part of the company were only 0.8%, worse than Wal-Mart and Target, according to reports of their most recent earnings. Amazon's margin across the whole company was 2.9% last quarter, but the strength of the number was provided by Amazon-Web-Services. North American e-commerce sales were $26.2 billion, on which the Amazon had an operating profit of $816 million. International e-commerce revenue was $14 billion, on which the Amazon lost $487 million. Amazon-Web-Services revenue was $3.5 billion, and its operating profit was $926 million. For the entire company, revenue was $43.7 billion, on which Amazon had an operating profit of $1.3 billion. In its fiscal third quarter, which ended October 31, Wal-Mart's revenue was $117.2 billion, on which Wal-Mart had operating income of $5.1 billion, or 4.3%. Since e-commerce is such a small part of Wal-Mart revenue, the measures are almost entirely from brick-and-mortar sales. Wal-Mart model is supposed to be a disadvantage. Based on operating margin it is not. Amazon management may argue it continues to invest in the future. However, Wal-Mart management would make the same argument as well. Target's most recent quarter was considered poor. However, Target’s operating margin was strong, as measured against most other large brick-and-mortar retailers. Revenue fell 6.7% to $16.4 billion for the period that ended at the close of October. Operating income was $1.1 billion, up 21.1%. That leaves an operating margin of 6.4%.Almost all large retailers make very little money in the current environment. Amazon makes almost nothing. It has been said over and over that at some point Amazon has to stop experimenting and investing in marketing enough to show a reasonable profit. ",Negative
Train2,"An apology for the bank's misbehaviours signed by the CEO of Deutsche Bank John Cryan is published as a newspaper ad in a big German paper in Frankfurt, Germany, Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017. Frankfurt, GermanyDeutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, has apologized in full-page German newspaper ads for misconduct that has cost the company billions. The ad, signed by CEO John Cryan on behalf of the Deutsche Bank 's top management, ran Saturday in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung. The Deutsche Bank bank said its past conduct ""not only cost us money, but also our reputation and trust."" In December, Deutsche Bank agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over its dealings in opaque bonds based on home loans in 2005-2007. Losses on such bonds packaged and sold by major banks helped start the global financial crisis. Other misconduct cases have included rigging widely-used interest benchmarks along with other big banks and money-laundering violations involving security trades Russia. The ad said ""we in the management committee and Deutsche Bank leadership as a whole will do everything in our power to keep such cases from happening again."" Cryan, who became co-CEO with Anshu Jain in 2015 and sole CEO in 2016, had to present a 1.4 billion euro ($1.5 billion) loss for the full year 2016 at the company's annual news conference on Thursday. Costs for legal settlements have played a role in weak earnings that have undermined the Deutsche Bank 's share price. Cryan also delivered an extensive apology at the news conference. Deutsche Bank is in the midst of a wrenching restructuring, cutting costs and shedding riskier assets to meet tougher regulation aimed at preventing another financial crisis. A news report that the mortgage-bond settlement might be as high as $14 million led to sharp falls in the bank's share price in September and October and fed speculation the bank might need to raise more capital or seek a government bailout. It did neither.",Negative
Train3,"In the week ended February 3, 2017, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States totaled 583 up by a 17 compared with the prior week and up 116 compared with a total of 467 a year ago. Including 145 other rigs drilling for natural gas and one rig listed as ""miscellaneous,"" there are a total of 729 working rigs in the country, up by 17 week over week and up by 158 year over year. The data come from the latest Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count released on Friday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for March delivery traded up 0.5% on Friday to settle at $53.83. Crude prices increased by about 1.2% week over week. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported last Wednesday that crude supplies had increased by 6.5 million barrels in the week ended January 27, and that gasoline supplies had risen by 3.9 million barrels.Attack Crude prices perked up a little at the end of the week following announcements that the promised production cuts from both OPEC and non-OPEC countries appeared to be happening. A little closer look shows how the cuts are being made. OPEC members have chopped about 840,000 barrels a day from production, according to a report at Bloomberg News. Saudi Arabia accounted for 500,000 of those barrels, and the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait combined to cut another 310,000 barrels. The other seven OPEC members have contributed relatively little. The January production cut represents about 83% of the 1.2 million daily barrels that OPEC had agreed to remove from production on average for the first six months of this year. Russia, the other big producer that has agreed to a 300,000 barrel daily reduction, cut its production by about 117,000 barrels a day in January. How long will Saudi Arabia be willing to take one for the team? The country has denied that it is the world's swing producer, the one that adjusts production to achieve the desired balance between supply and demand. Like it or not, the Saudis have likely adopted that role again. The natural gas rig count remained unchanged with a total of 145. The count for natural gas rigs is now up by 41 year over year. Natural gas for March delivery closed the week at $3.05 per million BTUs, down 34 cents (more than 10%) on the near-month contract compared with the prior week. Hedge funds — under the Managed Money heading in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC's) weekly Commitments of Traders report — dropped 2,978 short futures and options contracts for WTI crude oil last week, and added 6,009 long contracts.

Train4,"Dow Jones Industrial Average component Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is not having a good start to the year. The Verizon's stock has lost 8.99% of its value since the beginning of January. Compared with the prior week, Verizon dropped nearly 2% just last week. When it reported quarterly results two weeks ago, the Verizon forecast 2017 revenue flat on an organic basis, but that does not include divestitures of some assets and the still-pending acquisition of Yahoo. Verizon also missed both quarterly and full-year earnings and revenues estimates when it reported earnings. Overall, Verizon experienced a worse earnings reaction than we have seen in recent memory, falling 4.4% immediately after reporting results. Verizon was downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform with a $52 target price at FBR Capital Markets. Argus maintained its Buy rating and $60 target price on Verizon. Jefferies maintained the stock as Hold, but lowered its price target from $53 to $51 and noted: Results were indicative of the highly promotional fourth quarter, highlighted by an aggressive iPhone 7 promotion. While handset additions were positive, margins paid a steep price. ARPA and churn also disappointed. In our view, investors will be disappointed with guidance that implies only 1% EPS growth, well below expectations and prior commentary, driven primarily by expected continued ARPA pressures. On the upside, Verizon's 4.78% dividend yield keeps investors and analysts in the stock, as does demand for more and more data by the company's customers.

Train6,"Oil dropped further below $56 a barrel on Wednesday after an industry report pointed to a large rise in crude inventories in the United States, renewing oversupply concerns despite OPEC output curbs. U.S. crude inventories rose by a more-than-forecast 11.6 million barrels last week, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday, ahead of the government's supply report due later on Wednesday. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 29 cents at $55.63 a barrel at 0950 GMT. U.S. crude fell 40 cents to $52.74. If the API report of an inventory rise is confirmed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration report at 1530 GMT, it would be the ninth straight week of increases. Analysts had forecast a 1.9 million-barrel inventory rise. ""All eyes are on the EIA numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market strategist at Oanda in Singapore. ""A big washout of that will see oil test technical support levels."" U.S. crude supplies have continued to rise despite a supply cut that started on Jan. 1 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other non-members. Data has suggested high compliance with the deal. Total output reductions have exceeded 1.5 million barrels per day, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday, out of the almost 1.8 million bpd pledged. He also said the results had exceeded the low market expectations. Oil is also facing headwinds from a likely U.S. interest rate rise next week, a strong dollar and rising U.S. oil production, which has been given a boost by the OPEC-led effort to support prices. The EIA now expects U.S. crude production in 2017 to rise by 330,000 barrels per day, more than previously forecast, according to its monthly outlook on Tuesday. OPEC is trying to get rid of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at about half their level of mid-2014. Rising U.S. inventories have raised speculation it may extend the supply cut deal which runs until June. Officially, OPEC maintains that it is too early to talk of extending the agreement, a position reiterated by the Saudi minister on Tuesday.",Negative
Train7,"Deutsche Bank , the German lender tabbed last year by the International Monetary Fund as the most likely among global peers to cause a financial crisis, is taking drastic steps to make itself safer. Chief among the plans is an effort to raise 8 billion euros ($8.5 billion) of fresh equity to fortify the Frankfurt-based bank's financial strength. But will that resolve Deutsche's issues? Not according to Viola Risk Advisors' David Hendler, who's been arguing for at least six months that the lender needed to raise more capital -- even as the lender's CEO, John Cryan, said otherwise. Hendler says Deutsche Bank would still need another 9 billion to 19 billion euros to fully dissipate concerns that prompted many trading clients to take their business elsewhere last year. And since stock investors are unlikely to deliver such a large sum, he says, the German government will probably have to provide a bailout eventually. While Cryan said in a statement this week that his plan will create a ""simpler, stronger and growing bank,"" Hendler says the CEO's credibility is suspect after multiple recent strategy shifts. The biggest problem, as Hendler sees it, is that the bank has yet to demonstrate it can be profitable enough to compete on a global stage with the likes of JPMorgan Chase , the biggest U.S. bank. Investors who pour money into the lender now are likely to regret it later when the stock falls, Hendler says. ""They're going to waste through this capital,"" says Hendler, whose clients include bond investors as well as risk-management executives at big banks and insurers. ""You would be crazy to invest in this thing."" Over the weekend, Cryan and his team hashed out a plan to sell the new equity through a rights offering -- that is, by giving existing investors a chance to double down. The announcement sent the shares tumbling 7.7% on Monday, given the likely dilution of holders' stakes. The stock sale, to begin later this month and be completed by April, would be Deutsche Bank's third capital raise in seven years. The lender sold 8.5 billion euros of new equity in 2014 after a 10.1 billion-euro round in 2010. The shares, currently around 18 euros, are trading just below their lowest point during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. In June, the IMF said Deutsche Bank appears to be the most significant contributor to system-wide risks among the largest global banks. ""The capital increase will reinforce our financial strength substantially,"" Cryan said in the statement. The bank also announced drastic cost cuts and a plan to sell a minority stake in its money-management business through an initial public offering. The Deutsche Asset Management float, along with certain asset sales, would add another 2 billion euros to the bank's equity base. A bank spokesman declined to comment further, while forwarding excerpts from seven analysts' reports signaling support for the new plan. ""Ten billion euros is what will fix it once and for all,"" read one snippet. Prices for Deutsche Bank's credit-default swaps -- used by traders to hedge against the likelihood of a default -- have tumbled in recent weeks; that's an indication that traders see its creditworthiness improving. At the current price of 127 euros, however, they're still twice as expensive as similar instruments for JPMorgan. Deutsche Bank has said in the past that such comparisons aren't valid, because of differences between Germany's banking laws and those in the U.S. Hendler, who's based in Montebello, N.Y., says he's particularly troubled by illiquid, hard-to-value assets in Deutsche Bank's trading book that could bring steep losses if they were priced at more conservative levels. And employee morale is low, he says, following an 11% reduction in compensation in 2016, when the bank posted a full-year net loss of 1.4 billion euros. (In 2015, Deutsche Bank lost 7 billion euros.) Hendler's also concerned that many trading clients remain spooked and won't return. According to a Deutsche Bank presentation to analysts Monday, a key driver of profitability under the new plan will be to ""regain market share from improved capital position."" The brokerage firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods wrote in a report last month that Deutsche Bank's share of global fixed-income trading slipped to 12% last year from 14% in 2015. Meanwhile, JPMorgan and at least two other American banks -- Citigroup and Morgan Stanley -- gained share, the report showed. According to Deutsche Bank's statement, fixed-income trading revenue so far this year is up 30% from the same period of 2016. The full picture won't be available until late April, when Deutsche Bank and its U.S. rivals have reported first-quarter results.

Train9," Indian mobile carrier Reliance Communications' (RLCM.NS) shares and bonds resumed their slide on Monday as concerns over its heavy debt load were reignited after a fourth-quarter loss that sent the company to its first full-year loss. Banking sources told Reuters that the company is running behind on some loan repayments, though Reliance -- backed by billionaire Anil Ambani and widely known as RCom -- said it aims to repay lenders 250 billion rupees ($3.87 billion) by Sept. 30 following the planned merger of its wireless business with a smaller rival and selling an interest in its towers operation. While the company did not comment directly on whether it had delayed loan interest payments, the head of RCom's consumer business, Gurdeep Singh, said in a conference call that RCom was in talks with lenders to defer loan instalments coming due over the next four months as it works to close the two deals. Shares in the company fell more than 23 percent on Monday to a record low of 19.70 rupees before paring losses in afternoon trading. The stock, which has fallen 36 percent in the past 10 sessions, closed 20.4 percent down at 20.50 rupees. A sell-off in its 2020 bonds also resumed, with yields spiking as high as 17.7 percent after ending last week at 12.3 percent. ""Private banking clients holding RCom dollar bonds are panic selling in small lots following weak results and reports about delays in domestic loan repayments,"" said one trader with a foreign bank. The company on Saturday posted its second straight quarterly loss, dragged down by a price war in the wireless market instigated by the launch of Reliance Jio -- a venture backed by Anil's elder brother and India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. For the full year to end-March it lost 12.85 billion rupees. Anil won control of RCom when the Reliance empire was split in 2005 after a feud between the brothers. Mukesh ended up with the core oil refining and petrochemicals business, while Anil won control over the conglomerate's telecoms, financial services and power operations. The brothers have since settled their differences, with Mukesh's new telecoms venture Reliance Jio entering pacts with Anil's RCom to share towers and networks. But the price war sparked by months of free voice and data services from Jio have dented not only RCom, but also bigger rivals Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS), Idea Cellular (IDEA.NS) and Vodafone's (VOD.L) Indian business. ""The current stress in the telecoms sector is a matter of grave concern not only for the industry players but also for the financial sector, regulators and government,"" said Singh, urging the government to formulate a financing package aid the sector. RCom's customer base stood at 84.7 million subscribers at the end of March, down from 87.7 million at the end of December. Cashflow from operations turned negative in the three months to March 31, while average revenue per user was down 8.4 percent from the previous quarter and net debt rose 3.6 percent from the previous three months to 443.45 billion rupees ($6.87 billion). Executives of company, who were grilled by analysts on the conference call, said RCom will also cut debt by selling properties in New Delhi and the outskirts of Mumbai. RCom said it is expects lender approvals in a few months for the planned merger of its wireless business with that of smaller rival Aircel, and for the sale of a majority stake in its towers business to Canada's Brookfield (BAMa.TO) for 110 billion rupees. The cash from the deal with Brookfield will be used to repay some of its loans, while the combined 280 billion rupees in debt held by the combined RCom-Aircel wireless entity will be refinanced, company executives told analysts on the call.",Negative
Train10,"By the time President Donald Trump took office, he had already gotten involved in one of the world’s biggest mergers. In mid-January, the CEOs of Bayer and Monsanto, Werner Baumann and Hugh Grant, reported in a joint statement that they had a “very productive meeting” with the incoming president about their potential $66 billion merger. The deal, which the two companies announced in September, would combine the German pharmaceutical and chemical group with the US seed giant — a move they claim would boost agriculture research and innovation. “By the time 2050 rolls around, the world will have 10 billion people and the demand for food will double,” Robb Fraley, Monsanto’s Chief Technology Officer, tells Business Insider. “The whole point here is that the business combination between Monsanto and Bayer will allow the companies to invest in and create more innovation, and it's going to take a huge amount of innovation in order to double the world's food supply.” “From my perspective, they're saying the exact opposite of what most people in the industry actually believe,” Clay Govier, a farmer in central Nebraska, tells Business Insider. Govier is the fifth generation to work on his family farm of 3,000 acres, which primarily grows corn and soybeans. The farm has used Monsanto products for at least 12 years, and if this merger goes through, Govier's family expects seed and chemical prices to increase. With both corn and soybean commodity prices at some of the lowest levels they’ve been since 2012, that could put many small family farms in tough positions. “I just sat down to chat with my banker the other day, and fortunately we're in a position that I don't think we're going to have to have a hard conversation when it comes to loans for next year. But he said there are a lot of guys out there that are going to have a really hard conversation,” Govier says. With the increasing consolidation of the agriculture supply industry (Monsanto-Bayer is one of three major mergers on the table, along with Dow-DuPont and Syngenta-ChemChina), Govier doesn’t expect things to get easier anytime soon. “They’re locking in their profit and they're cornering the market by getting bigger, not by creating new products,” he says of Bayer and Monsanto. “They're just choking out the rest of the competition.” The size of the Bayer-Monsanto deal — it was the biggest merger announced in 2016 after AT&T and Time Warner — means the companies have to seek approval from regulators in 30 countries. The recent Trump Tower get-together, which occurred before the president nominated a Secretary of Agriculture, signaled the deal has a good chance of getting Trump's approval. In a statement, Baumann and Grant suggested that the new president shares their view of the agriculture industry’s need for innovation. To that end, the companies highlighted their plan to spend $16 billion on research and development worldwide over six years — an average of $2.67 billion per year. But a look at their current R&D budgets reveals that added up, the two companies already spend approximately $2.59 billion per year, so the combined increase in funds amounts to less than $500 million over six years. “Let's just cut to the chase — these companies want to make more money, they want to raise prices,” says Mark Connelly, an agriculture analyst at brokerage and investment group CLSA Americas. “No company in this industry needs these deals in order to innovate.” Data compiled by the Farmers Business Network (FBN), a data distribution network that collects crowd-sourced information from members, backs up Connelly’s concern. FBN analyzed corn seed yield (the number of bushels farmers can produce per acre) in relation to the seed brands’ market share; they found that, while increased market share did lead to more innovation, the rise wasn’t proportional. “After you got to a few percent market share, it really tapered off quite quickly. So going from 5 or 10 percent to 20 or 30 percent market share didn't lead to a massive yield increase,” says FBN co-founder Charles Baron. When plotting seed prices in relation to market share, FBN data also showed that greater market dominance was correlated with higher corn seed and chemical prices. That doesn't bode well for farmers, since several of the agricultural companies with proposed mergers already make up a significant portion of the market, according to Connelly’s analysis. “If you look at how much of the farmers' seed and pesticide dollars are going to these companies, Monsanto-Bayer — if it were one company today — would be getting $1 out of every $3. Dow-Dupont would be taking one out of every $4. Think that's a problem? Holy crap, right?” Bayer representatives acknowledged in a statement to Business Insider that they are often confronted with the allegation that the merger will raise prices and reduce innovation and competition. “We disagree with this and are convinced the opposite is true,” the company wrote. “We are competing with other very strong companies that offer similar products and have strong R&D capabilities. We will only succeed with pricing and selling our products if our value proposition to our customers is better than that of our competitors and if we continue to innovate. We are also convinced that in a competitive business such as the agriculture industry, the efficiency gains generated by innovation will increase returns for farmers.” Monsanto’s Fraley estimates that, under the current system, it takes about a decade for a company to develop and get approval for a new herbicide. Then if that product is popular, it'll take the company another 10 years to make a seed trait that responds to the new chemical. But since Bayer and Monsanto's combined resources might allow them to develop paired products in tandem, they could halve the time it takes to bring those new products to farmers, he says. Connelly has a different hypothesis. Monsanto has historically sought out partnerships and joint ventures with other companies that have innovative products. But that means dividing up profits. So Connelly predicts the size of a combined Monsanto-Bayer will lead them to favor a mediocre product or solution that they can develop in-house over a more promising one that would require a revenue-sharing partnership. “We're not going to be chasing the best solution anymore — we're going to be chasing the good enough solution,” Connelly says.  Todd Eney, a fourth-generation farmer in central Montana, says that as suppliers of seeds and chemicals have become more consolidated, he hasn’t seen many benefits. “These corporate bigwigs, are they really going to do what they say?” he asks. “Our farm has been out here since 1935 and I’m 40 years old and I’ve watched a lot of small family farms in our area go under. They can’t compete because they can’t pay the price of input because of what these companies are wanting to charge for input now.” Eney’s farm grows wheat, malt barley, and field peas, and uses Roundup, Monsanto’s popular weed killer. This year, he says, he and his father decided to use 50% less fertilizer in order to cut costs. The possibility of further consolidation has him on edge. “You know, it's almost like you shrug your shoulders and cross your fingers that your regulators are going to have a backbone and not let it happen,” he says.

Only the Ram truck division showed an increase, but up only 5% to 38,045 . Shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  surged in January. FCA's NYSE-traded common stock ended the month at $10.99, up 20.5% from its closing price on the last day of December. Chrysler shareholders had a bumpy ride in January. Share prices spiked early in January, after the company showed an electric minivan concept vehicle. Prices then fell sharply after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency charged the company with civil violations related to a diesel engine used in Ram pickups and the Jeep Grand Cherokee -- but began to recover once it became clear that the diesel issue was a minor one. The month's big news, however, was Chrysler's earnings report. Chrysler reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings on Jan. 26, and they were very good. The Italian-American automaker generated a net profit of 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in 2016, up from just 93 million euros ($100 million) the year before. Chrysler's guidance may have been even more cheering: The company forecasts increases in revenue, pre-tax earnings, and net profit in 2017, along with a significant reduction in its heavy long-term debt load. And it reiterated earlier guidance saying that it expects its total debt to fall below its cash holdings sometime in 2018. The most likely reason for GM's stock problem is its bloated inventory, which few people believe will disappear soon. In November, these inventories reached record highs, and the company resorted to discounts to clear lots. Ford's performance is puzzling. It is likely to be the U.S. car company least affected by potential trade friction with Mexico. According to MarketWatch: Shares of Ford Motor Co. surged Friday, after Barclays turned bullish on the auto maker on the view that the potential benefit of President Trump’s border tax plan hasn’t been fully priced in yet.Analyst Brian Johnson upgraded Ford to overweight from equal weight, and raised his stock price target to $15, which is 19% above current levels, from $13. “For all the discussions we’ve already had on a border adjustment scenario, we believe it is sill significantly underappreciated by the market,” Johnson wrote in a note to clients. “Our move to upgrade Ford is predicated on the idea that the stock will re-rate higher as investors better appreciate its relative advantages over peers in a border adjustment scenario.” Ford was burned by the factor which tends to affect stock prices the most. It's remarkably poor earnings. According to Barron's: Ford Motor reported its fourth-quarter earnings today, and the reaction today was very similar to the one in October, when it released its third-quarter earnings.  Not that the earnings were necessarily similar. Ford reported an adjusted fourth-quarter profit of 30 cents a share today–missing forecasts for 31 cents–on sales of $38.7 billion, and its shares have dropped 3.2% to $12.39 at 2:55 p.m. today. In October, Ford dropped 1.2% after beating earnings forecasts. MarketWatch’s Tomi Kilgore calls Ford’s earnings “one of the most unclear reports so far this earnings season.” He explains why: The automaker didn’t provide a year-ago number for earnings (or loss) per share, flipped the financial table to show prior-year results first and only provided a link on their press release to direct investors to their website to see the results….The commentary provided by Chief Executive Mark Fields and Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was only about the full-year performance, which showed the company swinging to a profit from 2015, with no mention of the $800 million loss recorded in the fourth quarter.

But NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse had refused recommendations to hive off some of the business that the merger would have covered. ""We could only have allowed a merger if the parties had offered sufficient remedies"" to regulator worries, the European Union's senior competition regulator Joaquin Almunia said on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately they only offered remedies limited in their scope,"" he said. Well-steeled in advance for losing the chance to become the world's biggest market operator, Deutsche Boerse said Wednesday the decision showed the EU was ""out of touch with reality."" ""This is a dark day for Europe and its future competitiveness on global financial markets,"" it raged. Deutsche Boerse chief Reto Francioni called the decision ""inconsistent with and even contradictory to the Commission's stated aim of expanding regulation on the over-the-counter derivatives market."" NYSE Euronext, which includes the New York Stock Exchange and exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam, said the EC decision was ""based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market."" ""As we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination,"" said NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels. In pursuing the deal, the two had to fend off a competing $11.3 billion bid by the Nasdaq and ICE exchanges for NYSE Euronext, which they had said valued NYSE Euronext at nearly 20 percent more than the German suitor's valuation. But that aggressive bid was ultimately scotched when US regulators signaled they would oppose it on anti-trust grounds. Analysts say Deutsche Boerse is better positioned than its US counterpart, anyway, because it is active across the whole range of activities, from its Xetra electronic stock-trading platform, to its Eurex derivatives market and its Luxembourg-based clearing subsidiary, Clearstream. Deutsche Boerse generates just 12 percent of its revenues from the highly competitive, low-margin stock-trading activities, while in the case of NYSE Euronext it accounts for around half of overall business.Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 1.25 percent in early trade Thursday after losing 0.5 percent Wednesday on the EC rejection of the deal.

Train20,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for OUTFRONT Media Inc. OUT. Shares have lost about 2.8% in that time frame, underperforming the market. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. OUTFRONT Media’s first-quarter 2017 adjusted FFO per share of $0.28 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure, however, came lower than the year-ago quarter figure of $0.34. Results reflected a weakness in national advertising market, mainly in the automotive category. Revenues for the quarter came in at $330.6 million, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $330.3 million. However, revenues declined 5.1% from the year-ago figure of $348.4 million. Quarter in Detail Billboard revenues of $236 million in the quarter declined 5.8% year over year. Results reflect disposition of the company's outdoor advertising business in Latin America, decline in average revenue per display (yield) mainly from a reduction in U.S. national advertising, the net effect of new and lost billboards in the period, and dismal performance in Canada. However, the negatives were partly offset by increased proceeds from condemnations and the conversion of static billboards to digital. Transit and other revenues also decreased 3.5% from the prior-year quarter to $94.6 million. The decline was due to reduction in U.S. national advertising revenues and disposition of outdoor business in Latin America, partly mitigated by the net effect of won and lost franchises. Operating expenses of $191.9 million contracted 4% year over year, mainly due to the disposition of Latin America business. However, it was partly offset by elevated expenses related to the company’s sports marketing operating segment. Operating income during the reported quarter was $26 million, reflecting an increase of 7.4% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization declined 9% year over year to $80.2 million. Net cash flow resulting from operating activities for the three-month period ending Mar 31, 2017 came in at $32.2 million, down from $33.8 million recorded in the comparable period last year. As of Mar 31, 2017, Outfront Media’s liquidity position comprised cash of $26.3 million, as well as $398.3 million of availability under its $430 million revolving credit facility, net of $31.7 million of issued letters of credit against the revolving credit facility. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. OUTFRONT Media Inc. Price and Consensus | OUTFRONT Media Inc. Quote At this time, the stock has a subpar Growth Score of 'D', however its Momentum is lagging a lot better with a 'F'. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of 'B' on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy. Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'C'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in. Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is solely suitable for value investors. Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift.  It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Train21,"Shares of Snap Inc. were falling 2% Monday after the stock's price target was cut to $18 from $20 at J.P. Morgan.

Chukumba said the company has now proven itself to no longer be a ""secularly challenged retailer."" Best Buy Is More Like Walmart, Less Like GameStop Best Buy shouldn't be grouped in the same category as troubled retailers, including GameStop Corp., Chukumba argued. Instead, Best Buy should be viewed as a retailer that boasts a market leading status although with a slow growth profile. Other retailers that offer a similar profile such as Costco Wholesale Corporation and Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) are trading in a range of 18x to 31x consensus fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share while Best Buy's stock is trading at a multiple of less than 15x. Chukumba also compared Best Buy's stock to Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT)'s stock which is one of the least expensive retailers. Best Buy compares favorably to Walmart across many metrics, including a much better operating margin expansion and earnings growth profile over the past few quarters, Chukumba emphasized. As such, at the very least Best Buy's stock should trade-line with Walmart's multiple which stands at 18.3x. As such, the analyst's revised price target of $72 per share implies a multiple of 18.0x on his 2017 diluted earnings per share estimate.

Train24,"Oil prices rose on Monday, with traders shifting money into crude futures as the dollar weakened, and on concerns that new U.S. sanctions against Iran could be extended to affect crude supplies. But markets were held back by more signs of growing U.S. production and by worries that import demand in China could slow. International Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were trading at $57.01 per barrel at 0620 GMT, up 20 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) were up 19 cents at $54.02 a barrel. Traders said the rising prices were a result of cash being poured into crude futures due to a weakening dollar and because of a generally firm outlook thanks to producer efforts to cut output. Investors raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Jan. 31 to a record 412,380 lots, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday. ""A weaker U.S.-dollar and OPEC news are supporting the base,"" said Jeffrey Halley of futures brokerage OANDA. The dollar has lost almost 4 percent in value against a basket of other currencies (.DXY) since early January, making investments into other products, including crude futures, more attractive. Traders said that tensions between Tehran and Washington were also supporting oil as a recent Iranian ballistic missile test prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards military unit. ""The move by the U.S. to impose new restrictions on Iran ... does raise the risk of further tensions disrupting supply,"" ANZ bank said. On the supply-side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers like Russia are trying to reduce a global fuel supply overhang by cutting their output by a planned average of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year. Despite this, crude was held back by rising U.S. drilling activity, where 17 oil rigs were added in the week to Feb. 3, bringing the total up to 583, the most since October 2015, according to Baker Hughes on Friday. Further downward pressure could come from a slowdown in Chinese imports. BMI Research said that around 6 percent of Chinese refining capacity would shut down at some point during the first half of the year, equivalent to around 900,000 bpd of capacity. A 6.7-percent reduction to 68.81 million tonnes between 2016 and 2017 crude import quotas for China's independent refiners will also weigh on the overall import demand, said BMI.",Negative

Train26,"The Keystone XL Pipeline (KXL) is a bet on much higher oil prices several years from now. It will take at least $85 oil prices to develop the new oil sand projects needed to fill the pipeline. It is also a bet that U.S. tight oil output will continue to grow and will need heavy oil to blend for refining. Both bets are risky. KXL would add about 830,000 barrels per day (b/d) to the 1.3 million b/d already moving through the base Keystone Pipeline system completed in 3 phases between 2010 and 2014 (Figure 1) when oil prices were more than $90 per barrel. (Click to enlarge) Figure 1. Location map of Keystone XL and Base Keystone pipeline systems. Source: TransCanada and Labyrinth Consulting Services, Inc. It was not until prices exceeded $70 per barrel in 2005 (December 2016 dollars) that oil sands expansion began to accelerate (Figure 2). Since then, production has almost doubled from 1.3 to 2.4 mmb/d and cumulative production has increased from 5.4 to 10 billion barrels. (Click to enlarge) Figure 2. Oil Sands Production Nearly Doubled After Oil Prices Exceeded $70 Per Barrel. Source: Statistics Canada and Labyrinth Consulting Services, Inc. By comparison, the Bakken and Eagle Ford tight oil plays have each produced 2.4 billion barrels. The Permian horizontal tight oil plays–Spraberry, Wolfcamp and Bone Spring–have produced less than 1 billion barrels.* Table 1. Comparison of Oil Sands and U.S. tight oil plays. Source: Statistics Canada, EIA, Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services, Inc. In 2015, oil prices averaged only $43 per barrel. No new oil sand projects have been sanctioned since oil prices collapsed in 2014 although 3 pilot projects have been approved since prices moved into the $50 per barrel range. Approval is not the same as sanctioning and these 3 projects together would add only 35,000 b/d. It seems unlikely that new greenfield projects will be sanctioned until oil prices move much higher (Canadian heavy oil (WCS) trades at a 25% discount to WTI). Assuming that prices stabilize in the $50 to $60 range, it is reasonable that pilots may evolve into brownfield expansion projects over the next year or two. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers estimates that annual oil sand production will grow 128,000 b/d until 2021 and then, grow more slowly at 59,000 b/d. If all of that new oil were going to KXL, it would not reach capacity for about 10 years. But other pipelines are already approved for expansion and will probably get much of the oil before KXL is completed. TransCanada’s bet, therefore, is that oil prices will move much higher and more quickly than most forecasts anticipate and that the volumes will be there by the time that the pipeline is built. U.S. tight oil plays produce ultra-light oil. Almost all of it is too light for refinery specifications. That means that it must be blended with heavy oil in order to be refined and that is why there is demand for Canadian heavy oil. The Keystone XL Pipeline is, therefore, a bet that tight oil plays will continue for several decades. Related: Oil Prices Up On Prospect Of New Iranian Sanctions",Negative
Train27,"The border adjustment tax proposal in House Republican’s tax reform blueprint is widely seen as benefiting U.S. oil producers because it would exempt exports and tax imports. But while it would favor U.S. drillers and refiners processing U.S. crude oil, it would impact refiners importing crude. Many experts and analysts believe that refiners that depend on foreign oil are likely to pass the cost of the import tariff on to U.S. drivers by raising gasoline prices. The border adjustment tax would also lead to the U.S. benchmark WTI Crude trading to a premium to Brent Crude almost immediately after the possible introduction of the tax plan. Most analysts, however, think that the likelihood of the border tax passing as-is in the tax reform are 30 percent or lower. But if this piece of legislation were to pass, U.S. drivers would be the ones to pay for the cost of imports—at the pump. “Assuming they’re proposing to impose a 20 percent tax on imports on countries from which we run a trade deficit, then we can expect gasoline prices to rise 30 cents per gallon,” Phil Verleger, president of economic consulting company PKVerleger LLC told Bloomberg by phone earlier this week. Verleger’s company, together with The Brattle Group, issued a white paper in December 2016 discussing the impact of the border adjustment import taxation on the U.S. crude oil and petroleum products market. “According to our calculations, the retail price of gasoline would increase by 13 percent, or approximately $0.30 per gallon, should the proposed border adjustment tax become law with a 20 percent tax rate. Retail prices of diesel fuel would rise by $0.27 per gallon or approximately 11 percent,” says the paper, which acknowledges the funding support provided by Koch Companies Public Sector. Goldman Sachs concurs that gasoline prices would go up, even if the proposed legislation would be beneficial to domestic drillers. “You do end up with higher gasoline prices. So the question, who’s ultimately going to pay for this tax, it’s going to end up being U.S. consumers,” Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Tuesday. Currie also warned of a mismatch that the border adjustment tax would create: refiners not wanting to import crude and wanting domestic crude, while producers would want to export it. Therefore, WTI prices would “need to move up high enough to make you indifferent between foreign crude and domestic”, the analyst said. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs had said that it expects WTI to move to a $10 per barrel premium to Brent from a $3 discount, a 25-percent immediate increase to the WTI price should the tax pass. Hedge fund Andurand Capital Management also sees WTI moving to a $10 per barrel premium to Brent and U.S. gasoline prices increasing, according to an investment outlook of the firm seen by Business Insider. Andurand says that there is a 30-percent chance that the border adjustment tax would go though. Related: The Oil War Is Only Just Getting Started According to Bloomberg, economist Alec Phillips - a former Senate Finance Committee staffer - sees chances as one-in-five for the tax to be introduced. Goldman estimates that there is a 20 percent probability that this tax policy would be implemented, “with the potential exemption of certain industries lowering the chances that it would impact the oil market further”. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said a few days ago that questions remain as to whether the border tax proposal would unduly burden U.S. consumers and businesses. A week before taking office, President Trump had said that the border adjustment taxation was “too complicated”, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Train28,"Oil prices gained slightly on Wednesday as investors covered short positions after a rise in U.S. crude inventories was not as massive as many had feared, while gasoline futures jumped nearly 4 percent after a surprise decline in inventories of the fuel. U.S. crude stocks rose by 13.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 3 as refineries cut output, while gasoline stocks decreased, the Energy Information Administration said. The surge in crude stocks did not shock the market, since preliminary data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) late on Tuesday showed an even bigger increase. ""A lot of the downside was already priced in,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""In the near term, this is going to become a technical game of price levels and where speculators are going to capitulate. If we start to get through the lows of January, that could force some speculators to retrench their position."" Hedge funds and other speculators raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Jan. 31 to the highest level on record, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday.

Gasoline futures (RBc1) jumped 3.9 percent to a session high of $1.5450 a gallon after EIA data showed the surprise decline in inventories after five straight weeks of increases. The U.S. gasoline crack spread, (RBc1-CLc1) a key measure of refiner margins, jumped as much as 20 percent, the biggest daily percentage gain since early November. Still, analysts said the gasoline market remained oversupplied. ""Prompt (U.S. East Coast) gasoline cracks continue to sell off and the contango in U.S. gasoline futures is deepening, reflecting the likelihood that the overhang will be carried into the summer months,"" Energy Aspects said in a note. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were trading at $55.20 per barrel by 1:54 p.m. EST (1854 GMT), up 15 cents or 0.3 percent from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was at $52.34 a barrel, up 17 cents or 0.3 percent.

Train30,"Millennials in Asia-Pacific are the most willing age group to justify ""unethical behavior"" in the workplace, according to an annual fraud report released on Tuesday. The online survey conducted by global consulting firm EY's Fraud Investigation and Dispute Services on about 1,700 employees from large companies across Asia-Pacific, said that young working adults of the region are more likely to condone dishonest methods in order to ""win and retain business."" The report titled, ""EY Asia-Pacific Fraud Survey 2017"", found that 38 percent of millennials or Generation-Y employees (defined as those aged 25 to 34 years old) would, if necessary, resort to ""cash payments"" to get ahead, compared to 28 percent of all respondents. Forty-two percent of working millennials would also ""extend the monthly reporting period to meet financial targets"", higher than 31 percent of all others surveyed. But the results do not mean that millennials are most likely to engage in fraudulent behavior. Millennials were found to be the age group least willing to work for an unethical employer, with 4-in-5 Generation-Y respondents indicating that they would seek another job should their current firm be embroiled in a fraud scandal. A key reason for the disparity is that company policies on ethical behavior often are adhered to by millennials when explained clearly without a lot of jargon. ""Clearly the message is not getting through,"" Chris Fordham, APAC leader of the fraud unit, said on CNBC's Squawk Box, citing the lack of simplicity and consistency in policies. ""The employees don't understand it; they want to act compliantly, but they're struggling to understand the policies which are too full of jargon."" But millennials are not alone in finding compliance efforts by companies to be a ball of confusion. Fordham said that while 93 percent of respondents felt that a robust compliance structure was key in deciding on an employer, 85 percent of them do not understand the policies in place, calling it ""a wake up call for businesses."" Although more compliance policies and processes have been put in place over the past three years, the expanding investment in corporate compliance has not paid off, with an alarming 69 percent of respondents saying they have concerns about company misconduct. He called for an overhaul in attitude towards tackling this lack of ethical conduct, ""management needs to invest time and effort now to ensure that the level of understanding from the manuals is increasing if they want to ensure sustainability of their workforce,"" such as through creating simple and specific policies.

Train31,"Check-in information boards are displayed at Heathrow Terminal 5 in London, Britain May 29, 2017.British Airways (BA) said it would take steps to ensure there was no repeat of a computer system failure that stranded 75,000 passengers over a holiday weekend and turned into a public relations disaster. BA had been forced to cancel all its flights from Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, and Gatwick on Saturday after a power supply problem disrupted its operations worldwide and also hit its call centers and website. The airline was returning to normal on Monday, planning to run more than 95 percent of flights from London Heathrow and Gatwick, with only a handful of short-haul flights canceled. BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz said the root of the problem, which also affected passengers trying to fly into Britain, had been a power surge on Saturday morning which hit BA's flight, baggage and communication systems. It was so strong it also rendered the back-up systems ineffective, he said. ""Once the disruption is over, we will carry out an exhaustive investigation into what caused this incident, and take measures to ensure it never happens again,"" Cruz said. Over the weekend, some stranded passengers curled up under blankets on the floor or slumped on luggage trolleys, images that played prominently online and in newspapers. ""Apologizes all well and good but not enough. BA has lost another loyal customer #disgraceful,"" tweeted Tom Callway, who had been due to fly to Budapest. The company was left counting the cost of the disruption, both in terms of a one-off impact to its profit and the longer term damage to its reputation. Spanish-listed shares of parent company IAG , which also owns carriers Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, dropped 2.8 percent on Monday after the outage. The London-listed shares did not trade because of a public holiday. Flight compensation website Flightright.com said that with around 800 flights canceled at Gatwick and Heathrow on Saturday and Sunday, BA was looking at having to pay around 61 million euros ($68 million) in compensation under EU rules. That does not include the cost of reimbursing customers for hotel stays. BA would fully honor its compensation obligations, Cruz said. Of the 75,000 passengers who missed out on flights, around two-thirds would have been flown to their destinations by the end of Monday, he added. BA has been cutting costs to respond to competition on short-haul routes from Ryanair and easyJet and recently faced criticism for starting to charge passengers for their in-flight snacks. Ireland's Ryanair was quick to seize on the marketing opportunity, tweeting ""Should have flown Ryanair"" with a picture of the 'Computer says no' sketch from the TV series ""Little Britain"" to poke fun at BA. Ryanair said it had seen a spike in bookings over the weekend but gave no further details. The GMB union said that BA's IT systems had shortcomings after they made a number of staff redundant and shifted their work to India in 2016. ""This could have all been avoided. BA in 2016 made hundreds of dedicated and loyal IT staff redundant and outsourced the work to India,"" Mick Rix, GMB National Officer for Aviation, said. ""They've all been local issues around a local data center, which has been managed and fixed by local resources,"" he told Sky News. Several passengers complained about a lack of information from BA staff at the airport. Others said their luggage had been lost. The airline said it was working to get reunite passengers with their luggage after many items were left at Heathrow over the weekend, although staff on Twitter warned this ""could take some time"". While other airlines have been hit by computer problems, the scale and length of BA's troubles were unusual. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled thousands of flights and delayed many others last August after an outage hit its computer systems.

While the rate increases were modest, they suggested Beijing was intent on both containing capital outflows and reining in risks to the financial system created by years of debt-fuelled stimulus. It was the first move in the repo rate since October 2015. ""This change is ground-breaking and suggests that the central bank will change onshore rates more frequently,"" wrote analysts at ANZ in a note.

""It's unlikely there will be a rate hike in March as there is too much political unrest in the United States. At least in the first half of the year, gold should do quite well,"" Lan said.

Train39,"Is your portfolio prepared for the next drop? Don't believe everything you see. In theory, the buy-and-hold approach is the surest way to make your retirement dreams come true. The market goes up over time. Always has, always will. Of course, it’s not really that simple, and Clarity Financial economist Lance Roberts revisited the oft-overlooked risks of that approach in his latest post for the Real Investment Daily blog. He focused on one chart, in particular, that he says has been floating around cyberspace in various forms over the last few months. It’s meant to minimize the impact of bear markets, to make them appear “harmless” and “relatively small.” With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) continuing their push into uncharted territory, it’s not hard to understand the need for some reassurances for investors who are growing increasingly skittish about the potential dying of the bull. As you can see, this chart should help soothe the nerves: But, as Roberts points out, it’s deceptive. And worse, dangerous. In fact, you absolutely must worry about corrections, he warns. “Let’s look at this realistically,” Roberts wrote. “The average American faces a real dilemma heading into retirement. Unfortunately, individuals only have a finite investing time horizon until they retire. Therefore, as opposed to studies discussing ‘long-term investing’ without defining what the ‘long term’ actually is – it is ‘TIME’ that we should be focusing on.” Investors, for the most part, don’t really start focusing on retirement savings until their mid-40s, after putting the slog of young adulthood behind them. “This leaves most individuals with just 20 to 25 productive work years before retirement age to achieve investment goals,” he said. “This is where the problem is. There are periods in history, where returns over a 20-year period have been close to zero or even negative.” The chart uses percentage returns, which he says are “extremely deceptive.” Essentially, if an index goes from 1,000 to 8,000, that’s a 700% return. Then, if it corrects 50%, who cares? But that kind of hit cuts your gains to just 300%. “Then,” he says, “the problem now becomes the issue of having to regain those 4,000 lost points just to break even.” Roberts posted this inflation-adjusted chart as a much more accurate depiction of market behavior. The table on the right shows how there have been several periods where gains have been entirely, or almost entirely, erased during a reversal. “Before sticking your head in the sand, and ignoring market risk based on an article touting ‘long-term investing always wins,’ ask yourself who really benefits?” Roberts said. “This time is ‘not different.’ If the last two bear markets haven’t taught you this by now, I am not sure what will. Maybe the third time will be the charm.” Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles.",Negative
Train40,"Anthony Levandowski, former Uber engineer accused in a trade secrets suit involving files he purportedly purloined from Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo has been fired San Francisco (AFP) - Uber on Tuesday confirmed that it has fired an engineer accused in a trade secrets suit involving files he purportedly purloined from Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo. The firing of Anthony Levandowski came just ahead of a date set by a judge for Uber to return files taken from Waymo. Levandowski missed a company deadline for assisting with an internal investigation related to the litigation, according to an Uber spokesperson who asked not to be named. The case stems from a lawsuit filed in February by Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car unit, which claimed former manager Levandowski took a trove of technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto and was later acquired by Uber. San Francisco-based Uber said it pressed Levandowski for months to help with the investigation, and did not want to wait until the matter made its way through the courts to decide whether to let him go. In mid-May, US District Court Judge William Alsup issued a partial injunction that fell short of the complete shutdown of Uber's self-driving car efforts that Alphabet lawyers had requested. ""Waymo has supplied a compelling record that Levandowski pilfered over 14,000 files from Waymo, and that Uber knew or should have known as much when it brought him on board,"" Alsup said in his order. Waymo's lawsuit contends that Levandowski in December 2015 downloaded files from a highly confidential design server to a laptop and took the data with him to the startup. The judge ordered Uber to do everything in its power to prevent information taken from Waymo from being used at the on-demand ride company and to return all copies to Waymo, or the court, by the end of May. Under the order, Levandowski was barred from being involved at Uber with anything to do with LiDAR, an object-sensing technology used to help self-driving cars ""see,"" which is at the heart of the suit. Waymo argued in the lawsuit that a ""calculated theft"" of its technology netted Otto a buyout of more than $500 million and enabled Uber to revive a stalled self-driving car program. Uber acquired commercial transport-focused Otto late last year as the company pressed ahead with its pursuit of self-driving technology.

Train43,"Drew Angerer | Getty Images. Mary Meeker's internet report suggests online ad market now a duopoly, while Microsoft's Skype unit has joined Facebook in aping Snapchat features. Snap's (NYSE: SNAP) challenges are mounting as a growing number of rivals attack its core business — and Wall Street is beginning to take it seriously. Stock analysts who cover the company now see Snap posting wider losses for this year and next than they expected three months ago, the latest data from Yahoo Finance shows. Most recently, JPMorgan cut its 2017 price target on Snap to $18 from $20 on Monday. What's more, the company's shares slid in last week — even as the broader market for tech stocks rose — after an influential internet report released Wednesday showed just how big a challenge Snap faces in the online ad market. If Snap can't innovate fast enough to stay ahead of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and other much-larger rivals, the company may find itself trying to generate growth out of an ever-smaller slice of the digital ad pie. Taken together, the latest news on the company suggests that investors who are betting on Snap shares will see more of the bumpy ride that's followed its early March IPO. The shares, which closed Friday at just over $21 a share, have traded as high as $29.44 and as low as $17.59. It was at $20.68 on Monday morning. The risks in owning Snap shares aren't news to anyone who read it's pre-IPO financial documents. The owner of Snapchat has never come close to making a profit and said plainly that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability."" The stock will also be under more pressure this summer as the lockup on roughly three-quarters of its shares expires in late July. But a look at the average estimate of analysts shows that Wall Street is expecting even deeper losses now than at the time of Snap's IPO. As of late Friday, the company was expected to lose 57 cents a share this year, a much wider than the loss of 44 cents expected in early March, and worse than the 51 cent loss seen just 30 days ago. The trend is the same for Snap's 2018 losses, which are now forecast at 34 cents a share, or about a third wider than the 26 cents projected three months ago. And those numbers exclude the costs of stock-based compensation, which continue to be significant at the company. In the first quarter, for example, those charges were $2 billion, or 13 times revenue of $150 million, driven higher by the company's IPO. Meanwhile, Snap shares have been slipping even while the Nasdaq composite index climbed to new highs. The drop came after Mary Meeker, the former Wall Street analyst who now tracks the web for the marquee venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, released her annual internet trends report on Wednesday. According to Meeker, Facebook and Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) captured 85 percent of the growth in online ad revenue last year. That suggests online advertising is fast becoming a duopoly that will leave little room for smaller rivals like Snap. Snapchat is seen capturing less than 1 percent of online ad revenue this year, according to the research firm eMarketer. ",Negative

But investors are now turning to stocks like Amazon's, which seem like they will grow regardless of whether President Donald Trump's economic agenda is fulfilled or not. Cramer argued that lower corporate taxes would not move the needle much for Amazon, since the company does not need to make more money right away to continue its global expansion. Bringing back cash from overseas, otherwise known as repatriation, would likely not interest the e-commerce giant either because of its focus on growing international operations. And deregulation does not affect the not-very-regulated Amazon, though Trump's hardliner stance on some of the United States' trading partners, like Germany , could bring tariffs on some goods, which could cause the company to lose money. ""In short, Amazon is a stock that performs better than a lot of others when it seems like Trump is incapable of getting anything done, and we just need to adjust to the status quo of slow growth with two interest rate hikes from the Fed , including one possibly coming next month,"" Cramer said. But the ""Mad Money"" host finds Amazon's status here to be problematic, mostly because of the way investors view the stock's brief blips over the $1,000 share price. The stocks of Amazon and fellow tech giant and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have run up 33 percent and 25 percent, respectively, since 2017 began. And while Amazon's ability to build its audience and be a go-to cloud provider for other companies and Alphabet's hidden value in its self-driving car arm, Waymo, are promising, Cramer says the companies need to execute to really be deserving of their recent gains. So, with Washington policy at a standstill, Cramer sees two ways this market can go. ""The first is that we begin a long, hot summer of wall-hitting, where one after another of these frantically thriving momentum stocks just goes full stop and starts building giant heads-and-shoulders patterns before tearing lower,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. The second is that other stocks join the rally, broadening the upward trend and suggesting that it has some staying power. ""We aren't there yet. We can't make a judgment, and who knows what will happen if the bears are wrong and the president actually gets his way on some tax reform, any tax reform,"" Cramer said. ""But the bottom line is that we need to be cognizant that a few big capitalization Nasdaq stocks are leading this parade and it really doesn't feel like [there are] enough followers yet to make us more comfortable.",Negative

Train46,"Tesla’s stock has surged 30% since the start of the year, largely on excitement about the upcoming launch of its Model 3, the $35,000 electric car that represents Tesla’s first foray into the mass market. But one analyst wrote in a note on Tuesday that investors may be overlooking other weaknesses: notably, Tesla’s higher-priced Model S and Model X don’t appear to be selling all that well. “While Model 3 remains the sizzle in the stock for now, our longer-term bias remains more negative given that Model X demand continues to show up soft (greater than 30% of future profit), Model S deliveries appear to be down year over year for three of the past four quarters, and Model 3 production ramp remains fraught with risk,” wrote Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson. Erickson said his team has checked with 20 U.S. sales centers and those conversations lead him to believe that the company’s first quarter sales are tracking in line or slightly below expectations. He’s seen evidence that the company is coaxing new buyers with discounts. Salespeople are “striking a late-in-the-quarter ‘everything must go’ tone, particularly regarding inventory models,” he wrote. While the Model 3 gets all the buzz, the S and X are expected to drive more than half of the company’s automotive gross profit over the longer term, Erickson calculates. Tesla also faces competition for the Model 3 from General Motors, which has already started delivering its Chevy Bolt, an electric car with a similar battery range and price as the Model 3. Erickson expects Tesla’s stock to trade in “the low $200s.” It was changing hands around $277 on Tuesday. ",Negative

Train52,"Amazon  could compete head-to-head against pharmacies and pharmacy managers someday, and that news was enough to send shares in CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) reeling more than 6% last month, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. According to CNBC, Amazon.com is hiring the people necessary to create a pharmacy benefit manager for its employees, and that could eventually lead to it rolling out pharmacy services commercially. The company has hired Mark Lyons, a former director at Premara Blue Cross who joined Amazon as senior manager of pharmacy benefits in April, according to his Linkedin profile. In his past roles, Lyons led a team of clinicians and analysts that supported national account managers with clinical consulting, including employer reporting and benefit consulting. He also has experience implementing pharmacy programs that manage prescription drug costs. Amazon.com hasn't officially let anyone in on its plans, but the potential to leverage its massive buying power and distribution infrastructure to cut costs out of the pharmacy supply chain was enough to spark worry in CVS Health investors. As a refresher, CVS Health operates a massive retail pharmacy footprint that includes over 9,600 stores, and it also manages pharmacy benefit programs for health insurers and self-insured companies. In the first quarter, CVS Health's retail and pharmacy benefit business generated a combined $44.5 billion (yes, billion) in revenue and net income of $953 million. It's no shocker that the drug distribution model is ripe for someone like Amazon.com to disrupt it. Drug companies have been all over the news because of alleged price gouging, and the current distribution model means wholesalers and retailers are increasing drug costs to consumers, too. Having said that, Amazon.com is famous for throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, and as fellow Fool Billy Duberstein recently pointed out, Amazon.com has traveled this road previously via an investment in drugstore.com, a now shuttered business. Perhaps, as Dubenstein suggests, the Drugstore.com experience provides lessons learned that Amazon.com can leverage for success. Or, perhaps Amazon.com's willingness to let Walgreens Boots Alliance acquire Drugstore.com is a sign that it has no interest in the regulatory craziness involved in running such a business. Only time will tell if Amazon.com will make a splash in pharmacy, but the threat to CVS Health's share price will likely remain until investors have a better understanding of its plans.",Negative
Train53,"Boeing Co is streamlining its aircraft production systems at its largest factory, trying to cut costs to compete with rival Airbus and chip away at the near-$30 billion deficit created by its 787 Dreamliner. Dozens of complex robots are replacing humans for such mundane tasks as drilling and riveting, and Boeing is reordering some of its assembly steps to speed up the process. The savings, part of a long-term cost-cutting drive at the world's biggest plane maker that also includes substantial staff reductions, comes as Boeing has spent heavily to develop new aircraft models. It poured $1 billion into erecting a 27-acre factory to make carbon composite wings for its forthcoming 777X widebody jet. It scaled the factory to produce 100 planes a year. But with only 306 firm orders for the 777X on its books, and the production rate falling, Boeing is challenging workers to find more efficient ways to do the work so it can avoid purchasing some of the planned machinery. ""Frankly, we would like to not to have to buy all of the equipment that we are currently sized for,"" said Eric Lindblad, vice president of the 777X program, during a recent factory tour. ""It's just saving money on capital."" Behind him, only two of six bays built to hold carbon fiber placement machines had been outfitted with all equipment. Boeing also has set up a temporary low-rate assembly line for initial production (LRIP) of the 777X so it can test processes before hitting the acceleration pedal. The ""LRIP"" strategy comes in part from painful lessons on the 787 line, where early aircraft that came out of the factory needed heavy reworking. This time, ""we are actually testing the primary elements of that new production capability"" on the 777, a plane Boeing already knows how to make, said Jason Clark, vice president of 777 and 777X operations. Final assembly of the 777X begins next year, with testing in 2019 and first delivery in 2020. Lindblad said it might be delivered a quarter early, if customers want, but not in 2019. On the 787 line, where wings, fuselage and other major pieces are shipped from suppliers and simply assembled at Boeing, the savings options are fewer. But teams are still taking out costs. They have slashed production time by more than two-thirds in four years through such changes as organizing kits so mechanics have all parts on hand and putting interiors into planes earlier on the assembly line, said Bob Manelski, director of 787 business operations. Boeing builds the 787 in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. That allows it to try out new techniques on one line at a time. A year ago, it started noting a ""champion time"" for fastest production and analyzing how that was done. The savings are crucial to paying back about $27 billion in deferred 787 production costs racked up by the first few hundred 787s. Boeing's goal is to build the largest 787 version, the 787-10, in the same amount of time as the two smaller versions - and for the same cost as the 787-9. It has no choice but to continue getting lean, Manelski said. ""We have to price the airplane more and more aggressively every time we got to the market."" (Reporting by Alwyn Scott)",Negative

On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the FDA said it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated, extended-release painkiller, Opana ER. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — U.S. regulators want a narcotic painkiller involved in the opioid epidemic off the market amid data showing people continue to abuse it. The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated, extended-release painkiller, Opana ER, after concluding the drugs's risks outweigh its benefits. It's the first time the FDA has asked a drugmaker to remove an opioid painkiller from the market. The agency said it has seen a ""significant shift"" from people crushing and snorting Opana ER to get high to injecting it. Endo said in a statement it's ""reviewing the request and is evaluating the full range of potential options."" Wall Street responded quickly with a sell-off, and Endo shares plunged 13.4 percent to $11.93 in trading after U.S. markets closed. The FDA move comes after advisers, reviewing the safety of Opana ER at a March hearing, voted 18-8 against keeping it on the market. Besides contributing to overdoses, abuse of Opana ER was blamed for a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles, according to the FDA. ""We are facing an opioid epidemic - a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. ""We will continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product's risks outweigh its benefits."" About 2 million Americans are addicted to prescription opioids, and 91 die every day from overdosing on a painkiller or much-cheaper heroin. Endo first got U.S. approval for its extended-release opioid, Opana ER, in 2006. It reformulated that drug in 2012 and claimed the changes made it harder to manipulate physically or chemically to abuse it. Endo tried to persuade FDA officials that the new formulation was abuse-resistant, which likely would have given the product a marketing advantage in the crowded, lucrative category of opioid painkillers. The FDA didn't agree, refusing to let Endo market the new formulation as abuse deterrent when it granted approval for sales several years ago. If Endo doesn't comply with the FDA's request to stop selling Opana ER, the agency can hold a hearing and start a formal process for rescinding its approval. According to the FDA, there are no generic versions of the reformulated Opana ER on the market. However, generic versions of both the original Opana ER and the original immediate-release version, called oxymorphone ER, are on sale. Those generic products might also face action by the FDA, which said it is ""assessing the latest available data on abuse patterns."" Endo Pharmaceuticals makes generic pills and specialty drugs, which generally are expensive medicines for complex disorders. It's part of Endo International plc, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has U.S. headquarters in the Philadelphia suburb of Malvern. Endo had about $4 billion in revenue last year, only $159 million of that from Opana",Negative

Train61,"Apple's HomePod Speaker Goes After Sonos More Than Amazon and Google As rumors swelled about the pending launch of an Apple (AAPL) home speaker/assistant device, many of those commenting about the reports couldn't help but point out a big challenge faced by Apple's effort: The company's Siri assistant generally isn't considered to be as Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft's (MSFT) rival offerings. Perhaps for this reason, and perhaps also for some others, Apple largely chose not to emphasize Siri when unveiling its HomePod speaker at its annual WWDC developer conference. Nor did it price the device to directly take on Amazon and Google's home speakers. Rather, Apple focused on using some of its core strengths -- its top-notch hardware and chip engineering, and its ability to create fairly seamless user experiences tying together hardware, software and cloud services -- to deliver a compelling solution for the connected home audio market. HomePod, which doesn't ship until December, is a $349 cylindrical device that's less than 7 inches tall, contains 6 microphones and is powered by Apple's A8 processor (found in the iPhone 6). There's no touchscreen, as some had speculated the device would have. But it is packed with audio technologies that one would more expect to see discussed in a Stereophile magazine column than at a tech giant's developer conference. These include a 4-inch Apple-designed woofer that automatically adjusts bass playback via software modeling, multi-channel echo cancellation, spatial awareness technology that detects a room's size and a speaker's location in it and 7 beam-forming tweeters that promise ""precise directional control of a multitude of [audio] beam shapes and sizes."" The last two features allow HomePods to simulate surround sound, with different audio elements (vocals, instruments, etc.) directed towards different parts of a room. In addition, two HomePod speakers can work in unison, with their music playback optimized to account for the other speaker's existence. And Apple promises setting up a HomePod will be as simple as holding an iPhone near it. Buyers will also be able to use Apple's new AirPlay 2 protocol to stream audio from iOS devices to HomePod speakers and third-party speakers in one or more rooms. As one would expect, HomePod integrates Siri and works well with Apple Music. Siri voice commands can be issued to play specifics songs, artists and albums from Apple Music, as well as do things like play songs from a particular genre or provide relevant information for a track. Siri can also be used to do many of the things one normally associates with the assistant, such as set reminders, read messages and deliver sports scores and traffic updates. But Apple SVP Phil Schiller spent far less time talking about the non-music features Siri can deliver via HomePods than its ability to deliver what he promised will be an unrivaled home music-listening experience. Moreover, Schiller signaled that Siri would only deliver services related to 14 specific fields (music, sports, messages, etc.), rather than fully replicate what Siri does on iPhones and iPads.",Positive
Train62,"In this Jan. 14, 2017, photo, tax forms sit on a desk at the start of the tax season rush, inside the offices of tax preparation firm Infinite Tax Solutions, in Boulder, Colo. Filing taxes early could speed your return and protect your identity. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) Tax season is here, and while you have until April 18 to file your return, you may want to think about doing so sooner rather than later. Here are a few expert tips on why: Identity theft is a growing problem and one often tied to tax refund fraud, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Once your return is filed with the IRS, the information — in particular your social security number — is locked and cannot be used again by anyone else. Steber suggests filing early to secure the information and your refund. It's one of the easiest forms of identity protection. If you're due a tax refund, the sooner you file the sooner you'll get it. Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and TurboTax expert, said that last tax season close to three out of four tax filers received a tax refund, and the average refund was about $2,800. That's a big boost to many households. While some delays are expected this year for filers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS still expects to issue more than nine out of 10 refunds in under three weeks from the day a return is received. Filing early gives you time to more carefully prepare your returns. People who wait until the last minute may forget something in their rush, Greene-Lewis said. Starting earlier gives you more time to gather your paperwork and seek help if needed. You should have received most of your tax paperwork by Jan. 31. If you owe money, filing early gives you more time to save up the cash, as your bill isn't due until April 18th. The bulk of taxpayers are not procrastinators, Greene-Lewis said. About 20 percent file in the last two weeks before the deadline, and another 10 to 12 percent pay later, but the majority file earlier.

Train64,"Mumbai, March 13: Pfizer Inc and Biocon today terminated an alliance to commercialise the Bangalore-based firm's biosimilar versions of insulin. Biocon had signed a deal in October 2010 with Pfizer to sell such insulin, used to treat diabetes.Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer made an upfront payment totalling $200 million. Biocon was eligible to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $150 million. It will also receive additional payments linked to Pfizer's sales of its four biosimilar insulin products across global markets. According to the deal, Pfizer had exclusive rights to commercialise these products globally, with certain exceptions that included co-exclusive rights with Biocon in Germany, India and Malaysia. Biosimilars are medicines that are similar to but not the same as innovator biologics. Biologics are drugs created from biological processes such as a living system. ""The companies have agreed that because of the individual priorities for their respective biosimilars businesses, it is in their best interest to move forward independently,"" Biocon said. Sources said Biocon would retain a little under $200 million that it received from Pfizer for the alliance. However, Biocon will now not have a partner to market the drug in global markets such as the US. Biocon is likely to look for partners overseas. All rights licensed to Pfizer will revert to Biocon, and all insulin distributed under the brand name Univia and Glarvia will be commercially available from Biocon only. On the BSE, the scrip finished with losses of 6.31 per cent at Rs 250.80. Pharma analysts said the development could impact earnings of Biocon for the next fiscal. After the deal was called off, brokerage Deutsche Bank cut its target price for Biocon to Rs 215.",Positive

Train66,"Amgen, Inc. AMGN presented encouraging results from a phase III study, evaluating its marketed drug Xgeva (denosumab) for an expanded indication at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The company is looking to expand Xgeva’s label for treating patients with multiple myeloma (blood cancer). We remind investors that in Apr 2017, Amgen announced submission of a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) to FDA to expand the label of Xgeva for the aforesaid indication. Additionally, the company has tendered a request to modify the marketing authorization to European Medicines Agency (EMA). Xgeva is already approved in the U.S. and the EU for prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. However, same is not the case for multiple myeloma. Xgeva is also approved in the U.S. for treatment of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) that cannot be cured through surgery in adults and skeletally mature adolescents. Amgen’s share price movement shows the stock to outperform the Zacks classified Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry so far this year. The stock gained 8.9% compared to industry’s increase of 2.8% during the period. The phase III 482 study compared Xgeva to Novartis AG’s NVS Zometa (zoledronic acid). It, met the primary endpoint of analyzing the drugs’ non-inferiority in delaying the time to first on-study SRE in patients with multiple myeloma. The secondary endpoints involved assessing the superiority of Xgeva versus zoledronic acid, regarding delaying the time to first on-study SRE as well as first-and-subsequent SRE of the study. The overall survival (OS) was in favour of Xgeva, albeit statistically insignificant. While the progression-free survival (PFS) rate improved by 10.7 months, when treated with Xgeva versus Zometa. In a separate press release, the company had announced positive results from a phase II study of its marketed drug Imlygic (talimogene laherparepvec) in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s BMY Yervoy (ipilimumab) for treating patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV melanoma (skin cancer). The results were presented at the annual meeting of ASCO. Imlygic is already approved by FDA for local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma, recurrent after initial surgery. The phase II 264 study met its primary end points and demonstrated a higher objective response rate for the combination therapy. Data showed that 38.8% of patients treated with combination of Imlygic and Yervoy, achieved an objective response compared to 18% of patients treated with Yervoy alone. Per the company’s press release, myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer, affecting nearly 114,000 new patients worldwide and causing 80,000 deaths every year. Whereas, patients with melanoma has drastically increased in the past 40 years, with 132,000 cases annually occurring worldwide. Hence, there is a huge potential market opportunity for the company to tap into and address the unmet needs of patients in both areas.",Positive

Train69,"On Wednesday, rival PepsiCo (PEP) reported earnings that blew the world's most iconic soda brand out of the water, as TheStreet's Brian Sozzi reported. However, Pepsi's guidance disappointed investors, sending shares down slightly in Wednesday trading. Is this just giving investors a good opportunity to grab more shares at a better price? For the fourth quarter, PepsiCo saw profits of $1.4 billion, or 97 cents a share. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.20 a share, beating the $1.16 Wall Street had been expecting.But for full-year 2017, PepsiCo's projections of $5.09 a share missed the $5.16 a share that analysts had been expecting. However, although the company's 2017 guidance missed Wall Street's expectations, it's no reason to start being bearish on Pepsi's stock. As analyst Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo points out, the $5.09 a share earnings guidance would represent growth of 8%, which is above the company's average beginning-of-the-year guidance (around 6% to 7%). Pepsi has a habit of low-balling initial forecasts and raising them later in the year, pleasing its investors. Over at Coca-Cola, however, the fourth quarter was worse. Earnings fell year over year from 38 cents a share to 37 cents a share. And revenue slipped from $10.01 billion a year ago to $9.41 billion. For the fiscal year, Coke forecasts earnings will decline by 1% to 4%. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings to improve from $1.91 a share to $1.97 a share instead. The entire soda industry has been struggling due to consumers kicking the soda habit. Across the board, sales of sugary soda have decreased as Americans, in particular, opt for drinks they consider healthier. This is where PepsiCo's product portfolio has shone. The company has been increasing its holdings of non-soda alternatives. CEO Indra Nooyi remarked on Wednesday that the company's Naked Juice line is on track to becoming a billion-dollar brand. Nor have PepsiCo's profits been restricted to drinks. The company also owns many popular snack food brands, including the perennial favorite Frito-Lay. During the most recent quarter, the company's snack food divisions saw a global sales volume increase of 3%, while the beverage divisions saw a boost of only 1%.PepsiCo's diverse portfolio of brands continues to make the company's stock a better investment than rivals Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) . Whereas for years Coke has put too much focus on its core product, PepsiCo has been nimble and is now ready to adapt to consumers' sometimes rapidly changing tastes. Making itself an even better investment, PepsiCo has announced that it's increasing its annualized dividend by 7%, from $3.01 a share to $3.22 a share. Investors looking for bubbly profits should look for price dips in PepsiCo's stock as great opportunities to snap up shares.",Positive
Train70,"After a bruising fall from its spot as the world's third-largest mobile phone maker following its acquisition of Motorola three years ago, China's Lenovo Group Ltd is counting on a push upmarket to stop the bleeding in its smartphone business. While the company, which vies with HP as the world's largest PC maker, returned to profit in the year to March, losses in its smartphone business worsened as marketing expenses for new products and key component costs increased. The group's phone problems started after it acquired Motorola Mobility from Google for $2.9 billion in 2014 but struggled to integrate the assets. That, combined with fierce competition from lower-end manufacturers in its home base of China such as Xiaomi and Oppo, saw its global position fall to eighth in 2016. A recently announced reorganisation of its China business aimed at sharpening the PC brand's consumer focus comes amid an ongoing effort to tighten its mobile branding and shift the focus to pricier models under its Moto brand. ""Our strategy is to prioritise mature markets ... which need brands and innovative products, whereas emerging markets need efficiency,"" Chairman Yang Yuanqing said of Lenovo's mobile business at a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday. ""So we will have two teams catering to the two kinds of markets with different product lines."" Lenovo faces its toughest battle in its home base of China, where it has slipped out of the top 10 smartphone vendors. Shipments domestically declined 80 percent year-on-year or 55 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017, according to data from Canalys. The company currently has three phone brands in China - the premium Moto brand, the cheaper Lenovo series, and an online-focused ZUK brand launched in 2015. A Lenovo spokeswoman said its global mobile strategy would focus on the Motorola brand, although it would continue to support its other lines, such as ZUK. Moto products, including a premium series of modular phones designed with detachable components that can be replaced or upgraded, helped propel Lenovo to be the second-biggest vendor in Brazil, after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Yang said. Shipments in Brazil rose 56 percent in the first three months of the year according to Lenovo, overtaking India as its biggest market, where volume grew 34 percent. The average selling prices of Lenovo's mobile products rose 15.1 percent in the past year, according to its financial report. Mature market competition, where Yang said Lenovo's main rivals are Samsung and LG Electronics Inc, is less fierce than in emerging markets, where the low entry barrier allowed in ""too many Chinese vendors, some of which compete irrationally"". He added Lenovo will have three more telecom partners in the U.S. this year, while its performance in Western Europe is improving. Yang said Lenovo is on track to meet its goal of turning around the mobile business by the second half of the fiscal year starting in April. At the same time, some analysts say the company should cut its mobile losses in China and focus on building its strength in other markets. ""I think they should deep-six their China mobile business. Their non-China probably has a chance if it's very narrowly geographic and product focused,"" said Bernstein analyst Alberto Moel. Lenovo is the fourth-biggest smartphone seller in India, with a 9.5 percent market share, which compares with Samsung in top place with 28.1, according to IDC. While it faces increasing competition from new entrants Oppo and Vivo, it enjoys good brand loyalty. ""I like Lenovo phones for their good battery backup, smart looks and the overall experience,"" said Bhaskar Kotian, a Mumbai businessman who has purchased at least six Lenovo smartphones for friends and family in the past two years. Despite calls to write off its China problems, Yang insists there are no plans to walk away from its domestic mobile business. ""We would never give up our China mobile business, because it is 30 percent of the world market,"" he said.",Positive
Train71,"Earlier this month, Koninklijke Philips N.V.’s PHG President and CEO, Frans van Houten, had expressed discontent about the pace of adoption of connected care products. This is particularly alarming, considering the premium health-service provider has concertedly streamlined its massive business empire to focus mainly on healthcare. The company believes that the present structure of insurance institutions, which focuses on reimbursing critical care and not prevention of incidents, has played a major spoilsport in thwarting investments. Despite these concerns, Houten remains bullish that long-term growth drivers are intact and the upcoming quarters should witness a rebound in connected-care businesses. Shares of the company have returned 22.7% in the last six months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Products-Miscellaneous industry’s average gain of 14.5%. Also, the consensus analyst community is showing favor toward the stock as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has inched up from $1.56 to $1.57, supported by one upward estimate revisions versus zero downward. Read on to take a closer look on the long-term growth drivers and the major profit churners for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Philips remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends as Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners. To make the most of these favorable trends, the company recently launched the Philips Azurion, its next-generation image-guided therapy platform, to boost sales. Overall, the company is optimistic that higher levels of quality and regulatory expenditure in the first half of 2017 will drive growth for this vertical. Also, Philips has been focusing on bolt-on acquisitions to fortify its core business. Previously acquired companies, including the Volcano and PathXL, have been contributing significantly toward the company’s sales. Recently, Philips made two acquisitions — Australian Pharmacy Sleep and U.S. based firm, Respiratory Technologies — to enhance its respiratory- and sleep-care portfolio. In addition, the company’s Connected Care & Health Informatics vertical is also progressing well and seeing particular strength in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions. Furthermore, Philips is looking for opportunities in the budding image-guided minimally-invasive domain. To foster the development of interventional cardiology, Philips entered into a five-year interventional cardiology solutions agreement with DeltaHealth in China. This apart, the company’s Healthcare Informatics Solutions & Services margins have been improving constantly as Philips is transforming from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, which is a higher margin model with a stream of recurring revenues. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Cohu, Inc. COHU, Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI and NCR Corporation NCR. While Cohu sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Motorola Solutions and NCR Corporation hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Train79,"Consumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this website. Apple will enter the smart speaker market this year with a pricey new product that it claims combines everything a music lover wants with all the bells and whistles of a digital assistant. The HomePod, unveiled Monday at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, is a direct challenge to already popular devices made by Amazon and Google. Set to go on sale in December for $349, the HomePod is significantly more expensive than Amazon’s Echo ($179) and Google Home ($129). But what sets it apart from the competition, says Apple, is superior audio quality. According to Consumer Reports testers, the Echo rates just good for sound and the Google Home is only fair. “Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said. Apple’s senior vice-president of world marketing Phil Schiller noted in his presentation that while there are great-sounding speakers and great digital-assistant speakers on the market, nobody has succeeded in combining the two. But, he added, the HomePod will do just that. The new speaker, which stands just under 7-inches tall, will be able to adapt to its surroundings, according to Apple, providing high-end sound no matter the size of the room. It sports the same A8 chip found in iPhones, which the company claims will supply the processing power needed for such innovations. The speaker is designed to work with the Apple Music service. Consumer Reports has reached out to Apple to ask if the device will support popular services such as Pandora and Spotify, too. We will update this story with any response. At the same time, the HomePod will provide a new outlet for Siri, supplying information on demand through voice commands and integrated controls via Apple HomeKit for the operation of connected devices such as electronic home locks, lights and thermostats. And yet, the introduction of the HomePod marks a belated entry into the smart speaker market for Apple. Although Apple’s Siri digital assistant has been around since 2011, the company has not rushed to build it a device of its own. With the introduction of the Echo in 2014 and Google Home in late 2016, though, smart home hubs have become the new must-have tech item for many Americans. And so, Apple's conspicuous lack of a smart home speaker has made Siri easy to overlook. By contrast, analysts say the Echo has been a hot seller for Amazon, though it's hard to measure just how hot because the company doesn't break out hardware sales in its quarterly earnings. On top of the traditional smart home voice controls, the Echo benefits from its nearly seamless integration of Amazon.com, allowing users to order everything from groceries to books just by telling the device to do so. But if Apple’s HomePod is able to deliver the high-end sound quality it promises, it might gain an edge despite its late entry into the market. It's worth noting, however, that Sonos—a manufacturer known for delivering exceptional sound quality—has been working to integrate Alexa into its speaker line.

Train81,"It looks like a home assistant and it acts like a home assistant, but Apple Inc. says it has created a smart speaker with a focus on music. The company unveiled a speaker called “HomePod” on Monday at its annual developers conference. The device, which will retail at $349, can be voice-activated to play songs from Apple Music, and has a home assistant, Siri, built in, so that it can be used to send messages, check the weather or work with other smart home devices to control the lights or shades. However, Apple AAPL, -0.98%   stopped short of calling it a home assistant and thus a direct competitor to companies like Google Inc. GOOGL, +0.78% GOOG, +0.83%  , with its Google Home product, and Amazon Inc.’s AMZN, +0.46%   Amazon Echo. “It will reinvent home audio,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said during the conference. The 7-inch tubular speaker, which runs on an Apple A8 chip, works with an Apple Music subscription with the ability to play 40 million songs, and learns about the user’s music preferences to help them discover new music. Still, it has several similarities with the other home-assistant offerings. The speaker is spatially aware, so that it can sense its location in the room, and uses six microphones so that it can be voice-activated from anywhere in the room. This compares to Amazon’s offering, which uses seven microphones to hear user-activated commands across the room. All three devices can answer questions as well as control functions in the home when the device is paired with other smart home offerings. Apple has a higher price point than its competitors. Amazon Echo, powered by smart assistant Alexa, is 9.3 inches tall and retails for $179.99. Google Home, powered by Google Assistant, retails for $129. Where Apple may have the advantage is if it can, in fact, provide superior sound quality, given its stated focus on music. In the privacy arena, Apple executives touted the fact that until the user says “Hey Siri” the speaker does not send any information to Apple. When it does send information, it will be encrypted and will send an anonymous Siri ID to help with the commands the user is looking for. Privacy has been a concern with home devices, as the mics are constantly listening in to user conversations while waiting for the command words, such as “OK Google.” The HomePod will be available in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia in white and space gray.

""We will compete with technology, but win with people,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at Wal-Mart's annual shareholder meeting where all the company's board member nominations were approved. ""We will be people-led and tech-empowered."" The nod to store employees and the retail workforce was a departure from past years when the company focused shareholder presentations on the technology it was adopting to close the online gap with Amazon and beat other competitors. The shift followed complaints by labor groups that Wal-Mart had to do more for workers, despite the company's $2.7 billion investment in employee training and wages in 2015 and the 2016 wage increase to $10. McMillon's comments capped a three-day media event during which the company announced initiatives like a test program that allows store workers to deliver packages ordered on the retailer's website and the use of blockchain technology to ensure safety in its food supply chain. Wal-Mart's investments in technology helped deliver a 63 percent rise in first quarter online sales, up from 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter. Its results have also outshined rivals like Target Corp, department-store chains and apparel retailers. The shareholders meeting at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas, 30 miles from the company's headquarters in Bentonville, was packed with 14,000 people, including workers from around 27 countries and shareholders. The company tapped Blake Shelton to host the show which included pop stars like Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige and Rachel Platten. Wal-Mart's shareholders approved all 11 company-recommended board members and voted in-line with company wishes. None of the four shareholder proposals put forward were approved. One from Making Change at Wal-Mart, part of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, called for an independent chairman to act in the interests of Wal-Mart's hourly workers. ""How can any Wal-Mart associate build a better life when they have been with the company for five years or more and they make $9 or $10 an hour,"" said Amy Ritter from the labor group, who presented the proposal. For years, influential proxy advisory firms have recommended shareholders vote in favor of an independent board chairman without ties to management or the founding family, ever since bribery allegations several years ago exposed serious board oversight failures.

Train85,"Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced its next-generation high-end desktop processor family, known as the Core X-series of chips. This product family is aimed at gamers, content creators, and other users that demand more computing power than typical personal computer users need to perform their tasks. Intel's high-end desktop processors have historically been derived from the chips that the company builds for the server/workstation market, and the Core X-based processors are no different in this regard. Where Intel has made a change in this generation -- and it is a subtle one, to be sure -- is in the platform controller hub, or PCH, that powers the motherboards the new Core X chips plug into. In this column, I'd like to go over that change and what it could mean for the company's high-end desktop platform business now and in the future. How things were Prior high-end desktop platforms used the same PCH chip that was used in the company's high-end datacenter platforms. The datacenter PCH chips generally pack a lot more ""stuff"" than their mainstream desktop computer-oriented PCH counterparts. It's worth noting, though, that Intel has traditionally updated its datacenter PCH chips at a slower pace than it has its personal computer-specific PCH chips. This meant that at launch, the high-end desktop platforms were often more feature-rich than their mainstream desktop counterparts, but the mainstream desktop platforms would enjoy quicker PCH updates. What this ultimately resulted in is that in the middle of and toward the end of an Intel high-end desktop platform's life, the cheaper mainstream Intel desktop platforms were often simply more robust and, therefore, more desirable. Mainstream and high-end desktop now share common PCH Intel launched its latest high-end desktop platform a few days ago, and the PCH that pairs with it -- known as X299 -- isn't the same PCH that will be part of the company's upcoming Purley server platform. Instead, based on the published specifications of the X299 PCH, it appears to be nearly identical to the mainstream desktop Z270 PCH that Intel released earlier this year in capabilities",Positive
Train86,"On May 16, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) put out a press release titled ""Intel Shows 1.59X Performance Improvement in Upcoming Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family."" In the press release, Intel talked up the performance benefits of its upcoming data center chips relative to its prior-generation chips. The most interesting bit of this press release, though, was the company's disclosures around its upcoming 3D XPoint-based memory modules for data center applications. Investors may recall that at Intel's analyst day back in February, the company said that it believes that the total addressable market for such 3D XPoint-based memory modules could be worth approximately $8 billion by 2021. Those memory modules were supposed to ship this year alongside the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family mentioned above, but the technology was delayed. In that same press release, Intel says that a refreshed version of its Xeon Processor Scalable family, known as Cascade Lake, will support this technology. Of course, the fact that Intel intends to refresh its server platform in 2018 is encouraging. But the real story here is that we now know approximately when Intel still start enjoying revenue from 3D XPoint-based memory modules -- something that could help the company reaccelerate growth in its data center group (DCG). Two ways it can help reaccelerate DCG growth Intel previously aspired to a 15% compounded annual revenue growth rate for DCG, but it has had a rough time achieving that goal in recent years. The company has indicated that growth in some of the markets that DCG serves, like cloud computing and networking, continues to be robust, but sales of platforms into traditional enterprise servers have slumped. With the introduction of Cascade Lake and the 3D XPoint memory modules, there are two obvious ways that Intel's DCG could benefit. The first is that Intel will go from generating no revenue from sales of memory modules into the server market, to generating some positive amount of revenue once it starts shipping those 3D XPoint modules. At this point, the amount of revenue Intel will be able to rake in from these memory modules is unclear, as Intel hasn't guided such a figure, and any estimate on my part wouldn't be particularly valuable.

Train89,"Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) has a current market capitalization of $440 billion and 18,770 employees (as of March 31). But to maintain its dominance, the tech giant has to aggressively innovate, hacker style. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has built a company culture that encourages risk-taking, allowing his engineers to constantly try new software builds. ""I figure out what the high level directions I think we should go in are, who are the best people to work on those things, but then on a day-to-day basis, a lot of the decisions I am making are, 'Okay is this going to destroy the company? Because if not, then let them test it,'"" says Zuckerberg, on Reid Hoffman's Masters of Scale podcast. ""If the cost of the test isn't going to be super high, then in general, we are going to learn a lot more by experimenting and letting the teams go and explore the things that are worth exploring than by having a heavy hand in that,"" he explains. Facebook engineers all have the ability to build tweaks to the software and then test them on a group of between 10,000 and 50,000 users to get analytics on the experiments. ""At any given point in time, there isn't just one version of Facebook running, there are probably 10,000,"" says Zuckerberg, of the constant iterating. ""Any engineer at the company can decide they want to test something. There are some rules on sensitive things but in general an engineer can test something."" Hiring smart, ambitious people and then giving them the freedom to run their own experiments means that the platform is constantly in various stages of innovation. It also means that things can go wrong. Like in 2008. That summer, an intern named Ben accidentally took Facebook's entire site down while trying to test a solution for a bug. Zuckerberg later hired Ben. To be a successful entrepreneur, you have to be willing to be embarrassed, says Hoffman. ""Every entrepreneur must walk this fine line between fixable and fatal. The important thing is you push your experimentation to the limit."" That's because the potential downsides of mistakes are not as bad as missed opportunities for innovation, both Zuckerberg and Hoffman agree. ""When you are building internet software that you can change every day, I think there really is something to the strategy of just learn and go as quickly as you can, even if not every single release is perfect,"" says Zuckerberg. ""I think you are going to end up doing better over a year or two than you would be if you had just waited to get feedback for a year of all your ideas. ""So that's really core. I think more than any single product that we are working on at this point, that focus on learning quickly is the strategy of the company."" It's not always an easy adjustment. It can be hard for people who are used to succeeding to move fast and make mistakes. ""High achieving people have a tendency to be perfectionists and the same instincts that make us good students can make us lousy entrepreneurs,"" says Hoffman. But embracing this hacker-inspired philosophy is key to keeping teams nimble and to innovation. ""I think the strategy of Facebook is to learn as quickly as possible what our community wants us to do, and that encourages a culture that encourages people to try things and test things and fail,"" says Zuckerberg.

Train91,"The Indian government has unveiled its most ambitious target for public share sales so far, looking to capitalise on the robust domestic capital markets to cut its annual deficit. In last week's federal budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley set a 725 billion rupees ($10.76 billion) target for divestment in the 12 months from April 1, up from a revised 455 billion rupees goal in the current fiscal year. The government intends to raise 110 billion rupees from the listing of state-owned insurance companies, 465 billion rupees from the sale of stakes in state-owned companies on local stock exchanges and 150 billion rupees from strategic sales in 2017-18. Analysts and investors welcomed the budget, sending stocks and bonds broadly higher on promises of tax cuts and a lower fiscal deficit. However, the statement makes it clear that the capital markets will play a far greater role in the country's finances than in previous years. Jaitley proposed stock-market listings for three units of the state-owned Indian Railways and pledged to use more exchange traded funds to hold stakes in public-sector companies. The government also announced a lower-than-expected recapitalisation plan for state-owned banks, putting the sector under more pressure to tap the capital markets for funds. Including the insurance listings, the 2017-18 divestment target is more than double the 309 billion rupees raised in the current fiscal year through stake sales and buybacks in state-owned companies, including a 30 billion rupees stake in Larsen & Toubro held through the Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India ETF. Rating agency Icra said the divestment target appeared high, but its achievement ""would be crucial to ensure the budgeted reduction in the fiscal deficit and the lower than expected gross borrowing figure"". According to Nomura, the divestment target is optimistic and “some shortfall, as is the norm every year, is likely”. The proposed listings of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, Ircon International and Indian Railway Finance Corporation could net the government a total of 100 billion-150 billion rupees ($1.5 billion–$2.2 billion), according to early estimates of bankers. IRCTC handles the catering, ticketing and tourism operations of state-owned Indian Railways and is the country’s largest online ticketing company. Ircon is an engineering and construction entity specialising in transport infrastructure, and IRFC is Indian Railways’ financing arm. The spin-offs are by no means straightforward. While the budget reveals plans to list IRCTC, it has also done away with the service charge on online bookings, which contributes nearly a third of IRCTC’s revenue. In the financial year to March 31 2016, IRCTC reported a net profit of 1.8 billion rupees on revenue of 15 billion rupees. “At this rate, the listing of IRCTC will be a non-starter,” said one ECM banker. Bankers have said the listings of these units are a long way off as the government has to get the assets valued properly. Also, at this stage, it is unclear if the listings will be done through strategic sales or IPOs. While India has successfully sold stakes in state-owned companies through offers for sale, it has been slow to complete IPOs. Floats announced in Hindustan Aeronautics and Rashtriya Ispat years ago have yet to be completed. Last year, it initiated plans to sell stakes in Cochin Shipyard and Housing and Urban Development Corporation for a total of $300 million through IPOs. The government's deadline for the IPOs is March 31. The 110 billion rupees target for insurance sector listings builds on January's announcement of plans to sell, in stages, 25 percent stakes in each of General Insurance Corporation, National Insurance, New India Assurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance. GIC and NIA are seen as the strongest candidates and expected to list first. India's insurance regulator last year recommended that all companies under its charge should, at a certain stage of maturity, complete IPOs to improve their access to regulatory capital. After the successful 60 billion rupees follow-on offering of the CPSE-Exchange Traded Fund in January, the government plans to set up another ETF of state-owned companies and other private-sector entities in which it owns stakes in the 2017–2018 fiscal year. The federal budget allotted just 100 billion rupees for the recapitalisation of public-sector banks, potentially pushing more to tap the capital markets for regulatory capital as their asset qualities are expected to deteriorate after last November's demonetisation. “We believe banks need three times the allotted capital if they have to make provisions and grow at around 10 percent,” said Saswata Guha, a director at Fitch Ratings. Independent research provider CreditSights has said banks will have to raise 800 billion rupees in equity capital over the next two years to meet Basel III requirements. State-owned banks have been finding it hard to sell shares as investors have demanded steep discounts. As a result, most of these issues will involve AT1 bonds. Some banks are already chalking out plans for AT1 offerings. ""We are planning to raise 20 billion rupees from AT1 bonds in the near term as there is appetite,"" said a source at state-owned Bank of Baroda. The budget also proposed the listing and trading of security receipts (SRs), which asset reconstruction companies issued when purchasing banks' bad loans. “If SRs can be listed, it creates more opportunities for banks to sell them off and remove the risk from their books,"" said Ben You Ang, research analyst at CreditSights. The initial response to the budget statement has been positive. Economists took comfort in the government's commitment to financial discipline, with a fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent for 2017–18 versus 3.5 percent in 2016–17 and a new fiscal roadmap for a reduction in government debt to 60 percent of GDP from 66 percent in 2023. Equity market participants were relieved at the absence of much-feared taxation measures on long-term capital gains and the securities transactions. The budget also did its bit for the IPO market in allowing selected non-banking finance companies to invest in IPOs under the Qualified Institutional Buyer category. Currently, only banks and insurance companies are categorised as QIBs. Banking stocks rallied on hopes of a revival in credit growth on the back of higher spending and tax cuts for individuals and small businesses. Foreign institutional investors also welcomed the extension of the concessional 5 percent withholding tax until 2020 on sovereign rupee bonds. ""The reduced tax rate puts India more in line with other comparable government bond markets,"" said Teresa Kong, portfolio manager at Matthews Asia. Kong pointed out that the government's efforts to improve transparency, digitalisation and curb black money were other positives in the budget. The budget limited cash donations to political parties to 2,000 rupees, and proposed electoral bonds to bring bigger donations into the banking system. The details are not yet clear, but the scheme calls for individuals to make donations to political parties by buying bonds from banks, which the parties can then encash with the banks. ""I never heard of an electoral bond before,"" said one investment banker. ""It is a novel concept.""",Positive
Train92,"In early January Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice-president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, unveiled the UAE Energy Plan 2050, which aims to increase clean energy usage by 50% and improve energy efficiency by 40%. Moves to boost the use of renewable sources, nuclear power and clean fossil fuels in power generation will be funded by a federal government investment of Dh600bn ($163.4bn) over the next 33 years, equating to an annual spend of more than Dh17bn ($4.6bn). This is expected to translate to a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and savings worth Dh700bn ($190.6bn). More than 90% of the UAE’s energy demands are currently met by natural gas. Under the UAE Energy Plan 2050 the contribution of gas will be reduced to 38%, while that of clean fossil fuels, nuclear and renewable energy will be raised to 12%, 6% and 44%, respectively, by 2050. As the third-largest emirate in the country, Sharjah is expected to contribute substantially to these targets, particularly in terms of enhancing energy efficiency. By fully converting Sharjah’s power plants to combined-cycle generation technology – which is currently used in stations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Fujairah – the emirate should be able to increase its production efficiency by up to 50% and reduce carbon dioxide emission by 33%, according to estimates from the Sharjah National Oil Corporation (SNOC). Sharjah has already taken steps in this direction. In May the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA) began the process of evaluating bids to expand and convert its single-cycle Hamriyah power plant to a more efficient combined-cycle facility, according to local media. The expansion is expected to increase the plant’s capacity from 500 MW to between 1 GW and 1.5 GW. With 2220 KWh per sq metre per year of irradiance, Sharjah is also well positioned to develop solar energy facilities. According to the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority, also known as Shurooq, the emirate’s market potential for public and private investments in renewable projects is forecast to reach Dh1.13bn ($307.7bn) by 2020, with opportunities including solar thermal energy plants for water desalination, solar energy generation plants and solar-powered public lighting. One of the emirate’s main challenges in energy provision is its dependence on imports. A sizeable amount of Sharjah’s energy needs are currently imported in the form of electricity directly from Abu Dhabi, representing around 30% of Sharjah’s total consumption during summer and more than 50% in the colder months, when demand decreases. SEWA uses natural gas to generate the rest. SEWA sources half of the gas it needs during winter from local producers SNOC and Dana Gas, importing the rest from Abu Dhabi-based gas development and transportation initiative Dolphin Energy, which brings in gas from Qatar. During the warmest months of the year, SNOC and Dana Gas meet between 15% and 20% of Sharjah’s gas demand. The latter company came on-stream as a Sharjah-based gas supplier in February last year, when the company began production at the Zora gas field located in the Sharjah western offshore concession block. “Sharjah has historically had limited indigenous energy resources, so the addition of the Zora gas field in early 2016 was a welcome contribution to local production,” Patrick Allman-Ward, CEO of Dana Gas, told OBG. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by SNOC and German energy company Uniper in mid-October is expected to provide a more reliable supply of natural gas to meet growing energy demands in both Sharjah and further afield. “Sharjah has been working towards self-sufficiency for a long time. However, the recent MoU signed with Uniper to import liquefied natural gas [LNG] will satisfy the emirate’s needs and potentially those of other northern emirates,” Hatem Al Mosa, CEO of SNOC, told OBG. Under the terms of the agreement, LNG will be imported through Hamriyah Port, with the first delivery expected in the spring of 2018. The gas will then flow to Sharjah’s Sajaa gas field complex before continuing to the existing pipeline network that spreads across the five northern emirates.",Positive

The company's disappointing view for full-year 2017 has also been a big dampener. On the flip side, the Zacks analyst likes the company’s decision to hike its quarterly dividend and efforts to expand operations. On the valuation front, while UPS's forward 12-month P/E multiple has come down following the stock's post-Q4 results sell off, it still trades at a premium to peer FedEx. (You can read the full research report on United Parcel Service here >> ) Facebook shares lagged the S&P 500 index following the election, but have more than made up for that underperformance since the start of 2017 - the stock is up +19.6% in the year-to-date period vs. +6.3% gain for the index in that time period. Helping the stock's recent momentum has been the strong fourth quarter earnings report where it beat expectations on the back of live video, mobile and other key areas. Despite strong results, Facebook, as expected, maintained a cautious stance on future growth prospects. Perhaps far more important to the market is the long-term opportunity for Facebook through monetization of key properties like Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. The prospect of higher engagement levels of its a huge user base is another key positive in the Facebook story. The company is also dabbling in AR/VR and AI technologies, which also bode well for growth.

Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q4 Earnings & Sales Up from Last Year The covering analyst believes Dollar Tree's solid results were backed by increased traffic and reduced expenses. Also, fiscal 2016 results were impressive. Yum! Brands focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership and efficiency should aid in subsidizing the effects of the spin-off, per the Zacks analyst. The Zacks analyst is pleased by the recent Mexico City slots awarded by DOT. Moreover, the Virgin America acquisition is a big positive. However, integration risks remain. The covering analyst believes innovations, productivity improvements and aggressive media campaigns will drive solid growth. The covering analyst stresses that Biomarin's pipeline is on track with the Brineura launch expected this year. Though Juno's Q4 loss is slightly wider than expected, its sales beat estimates. However, discontinuation of study on its cancer drug JCAR015 may hurt investors' sentiment. The Zacks analyst thinks CBRE Group's persistent efforts to broaden its service offerings and focus on strategic acquisitions and partnerships are aiding its growth momentum. According to the covering analyst, Broadcom's Q1 results reflect continuing synergistic benefits from the merger with Avago, which is further expected to drive profitability going ahead. The Zacks analyst believes that CBOE Holdings' exposure to stiff competition and escalating expenses will continue to pose risks for the company.

Train95,"By taking advantage of the backdoor IRA strategy, high-income earners can have more tax-free funds available in retirement. Unless you've filed an extension with the Internal Revenue Service, the 2016 tax year is now history. You're probably ready to take a break from thinking about taxes at all, but there is no time like the present to consider how you might save on future payments to Uncle Sam — particularly if you're a high income earner ramping your saving for your golden years. There is a great strategy that high-earning households could be overlooking that may save significant taxes in retirement: setting up a Roth Individual Retirement Account. Roth IRAs are attractive for several reasons. While funded with after-tax dollars, any earnings are tax-deferred and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. In addition, Roth IRAs are not subject to the minimum annual withdrawals required from traditional IRAs during retirement, so they can also be an excellent tax-planning tool. Because there are income limits to open a Roth IRA, most people earning high salaries don't believe a Roth IRA is an option. Under the law, a single person with an annual adjusted gross income of $133,000 or more and a married couple making more than $196,000 cannot directly fund a Roth IRA. However, since an IRS rule change in 2010, there have been no income limits on converting funds initially made to traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs. By taking advantage of this strategy, many people can implement a long-term strategy to have more tax-free funds available in retirement. Most high earners are likely saving the maximum allowed in company 401(k) plans. After all, it's an easy way to save and consistently invest money that will grow over time, but there is a limit to these contributions. The ceiling for 2016 before-tax contributions is $24,000 for people age 50 and older. So how can a person save more and reduce their taxes? More from Portfolio Perspective How to start saving for retirement in your 50s What makes an advisor trustworthy? Buying stock? Ask yourself this question first The first step is to open an after-tax ""non-deductible"" traditional IRA and, if you are married, one for your spouse, too. Anyone is eligible to open a non-deductible IRA, even if contributing the maximum to a company 401(k) plan. For example, a person earning $300,000 annually who participates in his or her company's 401(k) plan can open a non-deductible IRA and contribute up to $5,500 annually, or $6,500 if over age 50. If married and both spouses are age 50 or older, they can contribute a combined $13,000. Once the after-tax IRA has been set up, the second step is to convert it into a Roth IRA. People setting up a new after-tax IRA should consult with a financial advisor on how quickly this account can be converted into a Roth IRA. If the account can be converted quickly, any taxes owed could be minimal. The more time between the initial contribution and conversion to a Roth IRA, the more likely these funds will generate a gain. If this occurs, taxes will be due on the gains. Here's an example of how an individual can employ this strategy. One of my clients who earns more than $500,000 annually makes the maximum contribution to his company's 401(k) and does not have an existing IRA. He and his wife, who are both more than 50 years old, will each make $6,500 in after-tax contributions into their respective traditional IRAs for 2016. They will do this again for 2017 (contributions must be made before April 18 for the 2016 tax year). Once these IRA contributions are made and the administrator processes the paperwork, the funds can be converted into Roth IRAs. As part of the client's overall investment portfolio, we plan to continue this strategy for the next several years, which will give him and his wife a tax-free source of retirement income. If my clients make these contributions for the next 10 years and decide to retire, they'll have $130,000 — plus any investment gains — in their Roth IRAs. Keep in mind that there are several caveats to this strategy, so consult a tax advisor before making any decisions. For one, a person with existing IRAs funded with pretax contributions will owe taxes when converting this money to a Roth IRA. Of course, this makes the strategy less appealing. However, for people without existing IRAs, the long-term benefit of this back-door Roth IRA strategy is that money in a Roth IRA will grow tax-free, and these funds are not taxed when the money is withdrawn during retirement. Just as a diversified investment portfolio is a sound strategy, diversifying income into a group of different retirement vehicles can help people get more from their savings in retirement.

Train96,"Toyota (TM) , which once waxed poetic about its partnership with Tesla (TSLA) , has sold off everything. Talk about a missed opportunity.  The Japanese carmarker, according to Bloomberg on Saturday, sold its 1.43% stake in electric car-maker Tesla in July of last year. That decision ended the collaboration between the two wave-makers in the auto industry. Since Jul. 1, 2016, Tesla's stock has surged some 65% to $339.85 as investors have grown ever more bullish on the outlook for CEO Elon Musk's creation.

Train98,"Boeing's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016.Singapore Airlines (SIA) <SIAL.SI> announced a provisional order worth $13.8 billion at list prices to buy 39 Boeing <BA.N> wide-body planes on Thursday as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus <AIR.PA> in the key market for big twinjets. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernize its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related U.S. jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under U.S. President Donald Trump. ""The carrier is a demanding customer, and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term,"" said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value closer to $6.5 billion or about a tenth of the U.S. planemaker's annual volume. ""While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning,"" he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. ""Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000,"" an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a ""good platform"" for airline needs. SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. ""What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations,"" Yusof said. SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value. It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric <GE.N> and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce <RR.L>. GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the $1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.",Positive
Train99,"Definitely a theme in the news this week: the continued resource dominance of China. Despite all the concerns the last couple of years about a China slowdown, data emerging for 2016 shows very strong Chinese resource demand. Evidenced by surging copper exports out of Latin America, and rising oil shipments from Russia. But perhaps the most interesting China item was BHR Partner's $1.14 billion buy-in to the Tenke copper project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A move notable for a number of reasons. First, it's one of the biggest private equity buys we've seen out of China for resources. Yes, there have been some huge mining and energy purchases by Chinese state companies. But this is different -- representing private money, sourced dominantly from within China but also with foreign capital in the mix. Even more important is the location of the deal. With BHR stepping into an African country that's viewed by many international operators as a challenging place to do business. It's almost assured that DR Congo would be outside the comfort zone for more-traditional Western private equity. But BHR seems to have no problems buying in here. Part of that may be the deal structure. With the fund investing alongside major miner China Molybdenum Co -- and reportedly receiving financial guarantees from that company, perhaps softening the risk of losses due to political instability. Or it may simply be that Chinese investors have a more pragmatic view of the world. Being willing to go where the opportunities are. And that could make such investors transformative for the global mining industry. As I've discussed in the past, Western mining private equity has been struggling the last few years. With several high-profile funds unable to deploy billions in capital raised from investors. A big part of that failure comes down to jurisdiction. With many of these funds reportedly considering only acquisitions in ""safe"" mining countries like Canada, Australia and perhaps Mexico. That creates a very skewed market. There are only so many good mining projects globally -- and even fewer that fall within the borders of the world's go-to mining nations. And the fact that so many investors are looking at the same spots means bidding is likely to be intense for any possible acquisitions that do come up. Related: The Oil War Is Only Just Getting Started The obvious solution is to step out geographically. But that's a strategy few private equity groups can pull off, due to strict covenants -- official or unofficial -- on their political risk profiles. This week's news suggests China's BHR has no such qualms. Potentially signaling a new kind of mining private equity investor emerging -- the high-impact buyer, searching for big projects wherever they may fall on Earth. Recent reports suggest that China's Power Capital is preparing a $3 billion mining fund -- which would be the largest on the planet. And that big cash pool could have the same global scope that BHR is demonstrating. Chinese buyers are almost certain to be more comfortable with Asian projects. And Africa is definitely on the table. Even jurisdictions like the Stans might get considered, given strong Chinese business connections in many of those countries -- places Western private equity would never greenlight. That's great news for project developers in spots a little outside of the geographic mainstream. And could be very good for Chinese PE investors -- who can benefit from China's strong political influence in accessing quality projects with little competition. We'll see if the Power Capital fund gets done, and if more PE investors start popping up in the Chinese resource space. If so, there could be a major shift coming in the M&A profile of the global mining sector.",Positive
Train100,"During the fourth quarter of 2014, Eminence Capital reduced its stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX). The fund held 291,421 shares of VRX, which accounted for 0.61% of the fund’s 4Q14 portfolio. The company had made up 1.23% of the fund’s 3Q14 portfolio with 638,212 shares. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of products: VRX currently markets its products in over 100 countries. Over the past few years, the company has been expanding its portfolio offerings and geographic footprint through numerous acquisitions, including Bausch & Lomb Holdings and Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation. On February 20, Valeant agreed to acquire Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) for $158 per share. Salix’s portfolio consisted of 22 products used to treat various gastrointestinal disorders. The total enterprise value of the Valeant–Salix transaction is $14.5 billion. The combination will likely achieve annual cost synergies of $500 million. The companies expect the deal to close in 2Q15. Valeant’s fourth-quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% on a year-over-year (or YoY) basis. US operations mainly drove this increase, and a negative foreign exchange impact partially offset it. Cash earnings per share (or EPS) grew 20% to $2.58. Generally accepted accounting principles (or GAAP) EPS was $1.56. GAAP cash from operations was up 191% to $816 million, including a $287-million gain from investment in Allergan (AGN). For the full year 2014, revenue grew 43% to $8.3 billion. GAAP EPS was $2.67, and adjusted operating cash flow was $2.5 billion. For 1Q15, VRX expects cash EPS to be at least $2.30. For the full year 2015, the company anticipates revenue growth of 14%–15%, which would put it in the range of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion. You can gain exposure to Valeant Pharmaceuticals by investing in the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund (VEU). Valeant accounts for 0.25% of VEU.

Train101,"Shares of Tesla, Inc. TSLA jumped 3.06% on Tuesday, closing at an all-time high once again. On top of that, the electric car behemoth earned high praise from one of the technology industry’s most famous names. Speculation surrounding Tesla's Model 3 sedan continues to help fuel the automaker's gains, even though the affordably priced electric car isn’t supposed to start shipping until the end of the year. Still, Tesla’s stock price has skyrocketed from $216.99 per share in early January to $335.10 today. The company’s market cap currently stands at $55 billion, which places it firmly ahead of General Motors GM and Ford F. This meteoric rise might seem crazy for a company that really doesn’t sell many cars. But Elon Musk keeps debuting innovations at a rapid pace. What’s more, Apple AAPL co-founder Steve Wozniak said in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday that he thinks Tesla might be the most innovative company in Silicon Valley. Wozniak spoke about the rise of artificial intelligence in everything from gaming to language. But he said the first “moonshot” will be the use of AI to produce self-driving vehicles. When he was asked who he thinks will drive this wave, he responded by saying that, in his view, Tesla (TSLA) is headed in the “best direction” to capitalize on the technology. He continued by stating that he thinks Tesla “put an awful lot of effort into very risky things,” in the transportation sector. Wozniak praised Musk’s commitment and vision. “I’m going to bet on Tesla,” he said. “They start with a car, the Tesla Model S, that made little sense in engineering terms, in how much you have to build for what price and what the market will be. But it fit one person's ideal of this will be the most beautiful, you know, a very beautiful, elegant and simple device to use."" The Apple co-founder also supported Musk’s plans to build faster traffic-free ground transportation, including the Hyperloop.

The deal was engineered by Heinz's owner, the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. “The entire industry has faced headwinds,” Kraft Chief Executive John Cahill, who will become vice chairman of the new Kraft Heinz Co., said on a conference call Wednesday. “This is a transformative transaction for our industry. It allows us to move and grow faster than we could on our own. ”Kraft, the maker of Oscar Mayer meats, Kraft macaroni and cheese, Jell-O and a host of other well-known but older brands, lately has struggled to keep up with competitors as shoppers demand fresher, less-processed food.

Train103,"While the oil price crash was forcing shale drillers to idle rigs, lay off workers, or go bust, some big producers continued to pump oil from conventional fields in the Permian. They were using a technology to capture the carbon dioxide produced in oil extraction and inject in back into the ground to extract more oil and extend the life of mature fields. This is the story of Hobbs, New Mexico—population 37,000+, situated next to the border with Texas in the Permian, which is now the main growth driver of the U.S. shale resurgence. Around Hobbs, Occidental Petroleum continued to produce low-cost oil amid the oil price slump, using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques which extract more oil from the ground, reuse CO2, and last but not least—comes with a tax credit. The EOR techniques, which many big companies have been employing, are estimated to be able to recover between 30 and 60 percent— or even more in some cases—of a reservoir’s original oil in place, compared to 10 percent in primary recovery and between 2 and 40 percent in secondary recovery. Apart from squeezing more oil from a well, the EOR could become even more attractive for oil companies as the U.S. Congress is expected to debate later this year extending the tax credits, and possibly lifting the credit values per metric ton of CO2 capture. In the midst of the downturn, wells around Hobbs kept pumping oil. “When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working,” Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member, told Reuters. Almost three-quarters of Occidental’s Permian Basin EOR business unit oil production is from fields that employ CO2 flooding, an EOR technique in which CO2 is injected into oil reservoirs, causing the trapped oil to flow more easily and efficiently. In 2015, when the price of oil was already on a downward curve, Occidental completed the first stage of its CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery expansion project at its South Hobbs Unit. The additional CO2 has resulted in a 50 percent increase in oil production, which is expected to grow over the next few years, according to the company. “We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn. That helped,” Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations, told Reuters. The two U.S. supermajors, Exxon and Chevron, are also using CO2-based EOR, including in conventional oil projects in the Permian. Although various studies discuss the potential use of EOR in shale, the technique has been employed only in conventional fields so far. According to Reuters, later this year the U.S. Congress is expected to discuss extending the tax credits, which were first introduced in 2008. The proposed legislation would increase the credit value to US$35 per metric ton of CO2 for EOR storage from US$10 now, according to a January 2017 report prepared by the National Energy Technology Laboratory and the Great Plains Institute for the U.S. Department of Energy. Earlier this year, the Great Plains Institute released a statement, calling upon President Donald Trump and Congress “to make CO2 pipelines a priority component of a broader national infrastructure agenda and recommending that the federal government support the development of CO2 pipeline networks that will securely transport large volumes of carbon dioxide to American oil fields for use in enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR).” Proponents and users of the CO2-EOR say that this technique is a win-win development in the fossil fuel industry: reducing emissions on the one hand, and boosting oil production on the other.",Positive
Train104,"Since the Vienna oil deal (30th December) oil prices have been in a game of tug-of-war. On one side is the optimistic viewpoint in the form of production cuts and its compliance. The meeting on 21st of January between the oil producers further bolstered that positivity. This week, Russian oil minister Novak said that 1.4mbpd has been taken of the global markets. On the other side rests the shale giant. Right after the deal was struck between OPEC and NOPEC producers, analysts and experts started weighing the possibilities. In any case it was anticipated that any cut in production resulting in increasing crude prices would definitely call for a surge in U.S. production. OPEC didn’t have to wait long as this phenomenon is already happening, U.S. frackers have added a significant number of rigs in the past weeks and as a result, U.S. oil production has increased about half a million barrels per day since mid-2016, touching 8.96 mbpd. In this tug-of-war, both the sides are commensurately strong and influential. One is bullish the other bearish for the oil prices. Mr. Trump right after stepping into the White house has signed a flurry of ‘executive orders’. Perhaps the most relevant one to oil prices, was the resurrection of Dakota Access and the Keystone XL pipeline. Oilprice.com recently covered the effects these pipelines would have on regional oil prices, attractiveness of connected shale basins such as the Bakken and the increase in U.S. oil production. “The pipeline will eliminate the need for 500 to 740 rail cars and/or more than 250 trucks needed to transport crude oil every day.” As a result, the Dakota Access Pipeline would not only add takeaway capacity for the Bakken, but it would also trim the transit costs, theoretically making the entire basin more economically viable. This would no doubt translate to higher capital expenditure from upstream companies, higher rig counts, more drilling and ultimately increased oil production, a reporter for Oilprice.com said. Moving oil by train costs around $5 per barrel more than moving it by pipeline. So in the mid-term, the completion of these pipelines and others, which may follow, will definitely add to U.S. production. The prospect of leasing more federal lands coupled with the OPEC installed price floor could add up to be a perfect recipe for U.S. Shale to undermine the Vienna Oil Deal. To quote Mr. Gaurav Sharma, who says in an article in Forbes: According to Fitch data, the Permian shale basin continues to exhibit considerable activity and has seen valuations rise on an acreage and drilling location basis. “Average acreage values are up about 50% from the first half of 2016 to over $35,500 per acre, while average drilling location values are up 57% to $2.2 million, with some approaching $3 million per location,” the ratings agency wrote in a recent client note, although it did add a caveat that “evidence of acreage flipping suggests valuations could be getting overdone, introducing the potential for lower full-cycle returns.” Another, perhaps underestimated factor is the proposed border tax, which if implemented will increase U.S. output, according to some estimates by more than 1 million barrels per day. Bloomberg reports, “Goldman Sachs (in a report) estimated that, at a 20 percent tax rate and current Brent crude oil prices, West Texas Intermediate might immediately swing to a premium of $10 a barrel. Under this scenario, Goldman forecasts U.S. oil output might rise by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2018, almost double its current projection”. Another underappreciated fundamental is the prospect of a stronger U.S. dollar. President Trump’s ambition to usher in an era of low taxes and less regulations, is another bearish signal for oil prices. The The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has already communicated the idea of 3 interest rate hikes this year. On the bullish side, apart from the production cuts, is the nearing summer driving season (April – September) which will certainly increase gasoline demand as millions of American take to the highways for summer vacations. “This year, the seasonal upside could be even greater than normal. With the lowest U.S. unemployment rate since before the recession of 2008, and two consecutive years of record SUV and light truck sales in 2015 and 2016, the coming summer driving season is likely to show records for miles driven and gasoline demand. In fact, there has been a record number of miles driven every month since December 2014. And a continued trend higher in the 12-month moving total of U.S. miles driven is likely to continue throughout 2017”, Bloomberg observes. While this may provide a short-term cushion for oil prices, gasoline inventory levels are currently still above the 5 year average. But as far as production cuts and compliance is concerned, as of now, the near-term outlook for oil looks relatively bright. It remains to be seen, however if OPEC is willing to extend its production cut deal in May, when the cartel is meeting. Mr. Khalid Al-Falih has already signaled that there will be no need of any further production deal as the production cuts will absorb all the excess supply.",Positive
Train105,"The cloud is going to change everything!"" IT professionals have been hearing that refrain for years. As far back as 2012, Tech Republic reported that routine maintenance and server admin jobs may be phased out as automation and cloud services are proven to deliver as much or more value as on-premises hardware. Fast-forward to today, and we see that some job descriptions and skills have, indeed, become less critical for maintaining an IT operation. But at the same time, the IT implementers on the front lines aren't seeing their jobs disappear; they're seeing their jobs evolve. As everyday maintenance chores go away, these professionals have more time to focus their talents on business challenges. In fact, a Cloud Industry Forum survey conducted in March 2017 found that 85 percent of companies have not reduced IT headcount as they embrace cloud services. This is certainly the case at G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, an Ohio-based beverage company where IT staff oversaw a steady migration from on-premises hardware and software to cloud infrastructure and services. With over 90 percent of the infrastructure running on Microsoft Cloud Services, the IT professionals at G&J are now involved more closely than ever with the business, solving problems and building new solutions as they manage a workforce of 1,600 employees. In this report, we'll hear from the IT professionals at G&J, in their own words, about their experiences with moving infrastructure, collaboration tools, mobile device management, and business intelligence functions into the cloud. G&J Pepsi is the largest family-owned and -operated Pepsi franchise bottler in the US, serving Ohio and Kentucky. Headquartered in Cincinnati, the company comprises four locations; the actual mixing and bottling happens in Columbus. In addition to packaging and distributing numerous soda brands in bottles and cans, G&J also makes its own bottles and prints its own packaging materials and store displays. Most of G&J's employees are drivers and merchandisers, who deliver products to stores and other venues and make sure they're displayed prominently. Prior to its embrace of cloud services and mobile devices, these G&J workers started each day with a sheaf of paper instructions for routing and record-keeping. Communicating changes to the field staff and collecting information from them was tedious and time-consuming. As cloud adoption spread from the server room to the end users, however, the IT professionals at G&J found innovative ways to collect more and better data, more quickly, with significantly less effort. ",Positive

Train107," Google aims to grow from the convergence of the internet, cloud computing and smartphones. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also has what it calls three bold ambitions. Microsoft’s first global goal is to create more personal computing. This makes sense as it builds off of the company’s multi-decade dominance in personal computing software, including its Windows operating systems and Office suite. MSFT’s Windows software, combined with Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) PC chip dominance, has been known as the “Wintel” franchise. Office 365 in the cloud is helping fulfill this goal. Microsoft’s second strategic goal is to reinvent productivity and business processes. This can be served by its third ambition, which is to help build intelligent cloud platforms. Its Azure initiative competes with Google’s related platforms, as well as those being pursued by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Accenture, and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). Oh, and MSFT wants people to play games, too. Its Xbox gaming system is a huge hit among gamers. This isn’t a bad consolation prize for essentially being left out on the software that drives smartphones. Alphabet’s Android is the undisputed winner in this space right now, followed by Apple’s iOS, which powers its iPhones. Microsoft’s recently-announced third-quarter results gave investors insight into how it is succeeding on its three primary ambitions. Reported third-quarter sales looked solid, jumping 8% to $22.1 billion. Growth wasn’t as nearly as robust when excluding the purchase of LinkedIn, which accounted for $975 million of the $1.6 billion boost in the top line. But still, the sales progress was commendable, given just how large Microsoft has grown. And, management sees only about a 1% hit to full-year earnings as a result of the LinkedIn purchase. Of the three main reporting segments, the Intelligent Cloud (IC) unit posted the strongest growth of 11% to account for nearly 31% of total sales. Azure cloud computing sales jumped a very impressive 95% and should lead the way in terms of overall growth for some time to come. This is the main reason investors remain (perhaps overly) enthused about Microsoft stock. More Personal Computing (MPC) was the weakest segment — sales fell 7% to 40% of the total sales pie. Surface sales were particularly weak and fell 26%. Tablet sales, including even Apple’s iPad, have been suffering amidst the strength of smart phone sales. This is a concern, but not a big deal in the overall context of the diversified sales and product base. Total company operating income growth of 6% (to $5.6 billion — a very impressive operating margin of 25.3%) was respectable, but hit by merger-related costs and expenses related to LinkedIn. MPC profit growth was actually quite strong, jumping 20% to $2.1 billion. The question for investors in Microsoft stock is if its growth potential is properly reflected in its valuation. Based off earnings expectations, I would say that there is at least a slight mismatch. The forward P/E of 24x prices in a number of years of above-market growth. Of course, Microsoft is a financial powerhouse. Its operating margin speaks to the scalability of software, and before Alphabet and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) came along, MSFT had one of the largest installed client bases on the entire planet. It also boasts $126 billion in cash on the balance sheet, though this is netted out by $76.2 billion in debt, which nearly doubled due to the cost of placing LinkedIn into the corporate fold. Considering the current valuation of MSFT stock, I am more inclined to invest in Alphabet at 29x forward earnings expectations. Or even Facebook at 31x. They have much higher growth potential.",Positive
Train108,"As a rule, it's a good idea to be skeptical of any claim that Tesla Motors (TSLA) is worth one exact amount or another, whether it's $100 or $800 per share. We're talking about a company that (officially at least) aims to ramp its annual vehicle production from about 84,000 in 2016 to 1 million in 2020, all while significantly growing its energy storage and solar installation businesses. Merely coming up with a range for what Tesla's sales and profits will look like in a few years is no mean feat. It requires making difficult guesses about how close the company -- no stranger to missing production and delivery targets -- will get to achieving its very ambitious manufacturing goals -- not to mention about what consumer demand for upcoming Tesla products will be like, and what kind of margins Tesla will reap on sales.On thing is clear, though: Following a 68% 2017 run-up that has left the company valued at $60 billion, Tesla needs to at least come close to reaching Elon Musk's ambitious goals to keep investors happy. Though Musk has talked about reaching a 1 million-car production run rate in 2020 -- Tesla's delivery goals for the year are likely a little lower -- analysts are more conservative in their modeling. On average, they see Tesla delivering 683,000 vehicles in 2020 -- still up about sixfold from expected 2017 deliveries of 114,000. Those 2020 deliveries, together with battery, solar and services revenue, are expected to yield adjusted EPS of $11.45, via net income of $2.17 billion. Thus, even if one assumes Tesla precisely hits those estimates, shares are now trading at 31 times what the company will earn three years from now. For comparison, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) , respectively, trade at 14 and 15 times their consensus 2020 adjusted EPS estimates. For Tesla to currently trade at around 20 times its 2020 EPS consensus rather than 30, it might need to deliver about 800,000 vehicles.

Ecommerce growth at Walmart US was strong as sales and GMV increased 63% and 69%, respectively.

Train111,"In the last trading session, U.S. stocks saw rocky trading, thanks to higher prospect of March rate hike and increased geopolitical concerns. Among the top ETFs, investors saw SPY lose 0.3%, and DIA and QQQ move lower by 0.2% on the day. Two more specialized ETFs are worth noting as both saw trading volume that was far outside of normal. In fact, both these funds experienced volume levels that were more than double their average for the most recent trading session. This could make these ETFs the ones to watch out for in the days ahead to see if this trend of extra-interest continues: PXJ: Volume 6.41 times average This energy ETF was in the spotlight yesterday as nearly 230,000 shares moved hands compared with an average of roughly 39,000 shares a day. We also saw some price movement as PXJ lost nearly 0.8% last session. The movement can largely be blamed on the CERAWeek Energy Conference, which has optimistic tone this year as oil price is up more than $20 per barrel from a year earlier. This can have a big impact on the energy stocks like what we find in this ETF portfolio. PXJ was down 4.6% in the past one month and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or ‘Hold’ rating with a High risk outlook. GDXJ: Volume 2.22 times average This gold mining ETF was under the microscope yesterday as more than 48.4 million shares moved hands. This compares with an average trading day of around 23.3 million shares and came as GDXJ shed about 6% in the session. The big move was largely the result of higher expectations for a U.S. interest-rate increase as early as this month that diminish the yellow metal’s attractiveness since it does not pay interest like fixed-income assets. GDXJ lost 21% in the past one month. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?
